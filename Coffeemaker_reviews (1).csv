John,3.0,"December 19, 2013","I enjoy coffee, and enjoy smelling it as it is brewing.  The absence of any smell resembling coffee while brewing or when holding the cup to my lips is extremely odd to me.  The absence of coffee taste, either brewed to regular or strong strength is strange.  Mr Coffee has been making these machines for 300 years, so I would have thought they'd perfected the craft by now.  I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews, and the price.  I have run through at least 6 cycles of vinegar and water, with each of those cycles followed by 2 fresh water cycles.  Nothing I have done has eliminated the scent of a hot rubber hose.  I have brewed a few pots of a hot liquid with many of the same apparent properties as coffee, but it smells and tastes like water that was run through a hot rubber hose.  I really do not like to give up easily, and am on my 7th cycle.  I am honestly a little hesitant to waste another few scoops of tasty ground beans on this device, but holding out some hope that the awful smell and taste can be neutralized.  One other thing to mention is that the smell is evident when only water is run through the system, the problem is evident by simply sniffing under the cover (after the steam clears).  I don't know if the one I received was made from a different batch, or a substituted rubber hose, or something that otherwise distinguishes this one from the others sold.  I like fresh coffee, but hardly think I am such a snob that I am being overly picky. Just perplexed right now....UPDATE....I found an alternative solution in some obscure corner of the interweb, and it actually worked fabulously.  Somebody suggested rubbing down the interior with alcohol.  He had experimented and concluded that the yucky plastic residue is soluble in vodka. First, I removed the tube that carries the hot water/steam and ran it through the dishwasher.  Then, I wiped down the interior with about a shot of vodka on a paper towel.  I also left a small amount in the bottom of the reservoir overnight to saturate the part of the tube that was inaccessible.  Amazingly, it worked.  I raised my rating from 1 star to 3.  I have not had it long enough to provide a longerm review, and the stink and rotten taste was a major problem that should not be an expected part of a purchase, in my opinion.  But, I am content now."
H. KITE,1.0,"March 7, 2016","I have tried and tried to like this coffee pot. But, it's just awful. The sprayer head sprays over toward the side of the basket, which causes that side of the coffee filter to collapse.  This, in turn, causes all of the grounds to leak out of the coffee filter and to go directly into your  pot of coffee.  This happens 7 times out of 10 when I brew coffee. Often, when I make a full pot of coffee, the water just overflows the entire basket area and I end up with coffee grounds inside of the coffee maker itself.  I returned the first pot I had because of this.  But, the 2nd  one does the exact same thing.  Most recently, after having this pot for 5 months, I broke the glass carafe (I had a Bunn coffee pot for years and years and never broke the glass carafe- this one shatters very easily).  So, I purchased the thermal carafe Mr. Coffee offers for this model.  The thermal carafe worked great the first 2 times I used it.  With the 3rd use, the coffee just pooled all over the top of the carafe and spilled out onto the coffee pot and all over the counters and the floor. I was not able to get the settings to change from ""glass"" to ""thermal"".  I GIVE UP!  I will no longer use this piece of junk.  I've had it for too long to return it.  So, I am just out the money I spent.  Also, believe  the reviews that say this leaves a plastic taste in the coffee- it definitely does!"
Steven Gearhart,2.0,"December 7, 2015","My opinion of this product is very mixed. The pros of this coffee maker are; its nice looks and for the price, makes good coffee. The cons are many. Deceptive marketing tactics on the quantity of coffee this unit makes. Mr. Coffee advertises that this unit will make 12 cups of coffee however it will only hold approximately 52 ounces of water. Either Mr. Coffee doesn't know how many ounces are in a cup or they redefined it to be 4.33 ounces per cup. Even their box shows that they have changed this to 6 ounces for a cup and not the standard 8 ounce per cup.  Aside from deceptive marketing, the clock is a small LCD clock with a gray background and black lettering which is recessed deep into the unit. You have to view this clock straight on or you will not be able to see it. Setting the time and brew times proves to be difficult because of this design. The final problem that I find with this coffee maker is the way they've designed the water reservoir. It traps massive amounts of condensation inside the unit and this concerns me about bacterial growth.. Overall, I would not recommend this coffee maker if other alternative products are available."
TukaFeedback,3.0,"February 11, 2016","Bought this product under 4 months ago, Loved it and the coffee tasted fine.  The best part was having an auto brew schedule.  However, the machine just stopped brewing completely.  Lights come on, but nada.  It won't even try to brew.  I found out by googling that this is a common product problem.  Did everything in the user manually and finally called the help desk.  The auto response system took way too long (4 min) and the  fourth option on their auto response is ""won't brew"" (find that funny).  Then the auto response tells me to clean the coffee maker by brewing it with vinegar.... c'mon guys... it won't brew!!  After 4 minutes, got a prompt to ask for a Representative.  The Representative was AMAZING.  She asked me a few simple questions, and hurray they are shipping me a brand new machine!  The part I feel bad about it filling up a landfill with this old one.  Just a shame it wasn't built with more quality, but I guess I get what I paid for.  Glad Mr. Coffee did well by us, lets hope the new one works better."
ZB,1.0,"October 2, 2015","I purchased this because my old cheap coffee maker had finally given up the ghost. When this arrived, I noticed a very strong plastic odor. I ran water through a few times and then made some tea (I don't drink coffee) with it. The plastic taste of the tea was so bad that I had to pour it out. I've since ran two gallons of vinegar and a bottle of vodka through (each followed by water to flush out the vinegar/vodka) and there is still a faint smell of plastic to it. I'm going to run vinegar through it one more time, followed by water a couple times. If I can still taste plastic in my tea after that, I will return it. Save yourself some trouble and spend a bit more on a better coffee maker. I should have, between the vodka, vinegar, and time invested in trying to get this usable, I could have had a really nice coffee maker.*UPDATE* I was finally able to use this coffee maker for what I bought it for. After three gallons of vinegar, a bottle of vodka, probably 30 total cycles to rinse the vodka or vinegar out, it still smelled like plastic. I ran two cycles of tea each time and poured them out after completion. I then made a pot of tea that finally did not taste like plastic. Be warned, the coffee machine still smells faintly of plastic. I still would not recommend this product. Spend a litlte more money and buy a better coffee maker."
John C.,1.0,"December 14, 2015","I ordered this coffee maker, assuming that it would be an upgrade from any and all of my previous Mr. Coffee makers. In actuality, it is a step backwards, in as much as their designers chose to put Design over Functionality. All of my previous programmable coffee makers had a LIGHTED ANALOG CLOCK and I thought that this one would have a lighted digital clock. Also, the designers failed, when they moved the reservoir water level marker, to the right side of the coffee maker. Now, you must depend on the accuracy of the markings on the decanter as the markings on the reservoir are out of view, It makes a good cup of coffee, but so did my old one's and it did not have the same bulk or shortcomings of this one. Had I realized it's short comings, I would never have made the purchase. I called Mr Coffee about these failures and looked at their web site, only to find that this particular model is NOT shown in their inventory, other than in Red and the suggested lighted models,were not shown either. Partial solution: Keep a flashlight handy, in order to read the digital and adjust settings 11/9/16-Comments justified. 11/9/16-COFFEE MAKER FAILED THIS MORNING.WILL NOT OPERATE IN ANY MODE. PREVIOUS COMMENTS JUSTIFIED. NO SOUR GRAPES. LESS THAN 1 YEAR OLD (Purchased 12/12/15)"
Bret,3.0,"September 26, 2015","I went back and forth over whether to give this two or three stars.  Ultimately decided on three, because it does make coffee at an adequate temperature (even if only barely so) without any huge pains in the neck...and because it is (or should be) commonly understood that a dirt cheap price often comes at the trade-off of quality or other form of consumer satisfaction.  This is no exception.Here are the problems I have experienced:1.  The ""strong brew"" function flat-out Does Not Work.  It worked for a couple of months and then dropped dead.  If I select the strong brew feature, the pot beeps (as though finished) about 10 second into the cycle and then continues under normal brew mode.  This appears to be a very common complaint, and Mr. Coffee is displaying no desire to fix it.  The response, after you filter out all the fluff and read between the lines, is: ""Noted...so just don't use that feature.""2.  As mentioned above, the water heating is only barely sufficient.  Consumer Reports recently dropped this coffee maker from its ""Recommended"" list because of this, and I agree with that decision.  The cup stays plenty warm if you sip it all down immediately (I don't know anyone who does this), but not after 15 minutes in a normal mug.3.  The carafe itself (I have the glass one) spills if you pour too quickly.  This typically isn't a problem while pouring brewed coffee (as I am not dumping it quickly then), but often when I use the clean carafe to pour fresh water into the back of the coffee maker, it spills out (and in excessive quantity, not just a few drops) onto the counter next to the coffee maker.  I can hear your reflexive response...""Just pour more slowly""...and I do, but this is still cheap, bush league stuff.  This is the 21st century...we have the technology available to make carafes that don't spill.Otherwise, it's fine.  ""Good enough"" anyway.  The programmable time brew function (what is called the ""delay"" feature) works well and has never let me down.  Some people have complained that the filter basket does not seat properly when the carafe is inserted, but that's baloney...it's designed that way on purpose.  There has to be weight in the filter basket to compress the spring, and the water that fills it provides more than enough weight to do so.  It may even be designed that way to keep the water in the filter longer and thus extract more coffee from the grounds (then again, the unimpressive water heating & non-functioning strong brew feature certainly counterbalance this design).  It may look weird, but this part (at least in isolation) works just fine.Enough rambling already.  If you buy this, do so because you're on a budget and you don't mind coffee that cools off quickly after it is poured and isn't particularly strong.  Me personally, I like my coffee hot and strong, so I will be replacing this thing some time soon."
Michael Rothberg,4.0,"December 2, 2014","Nice product.  The control panel is a little more complicated than necessary because of some unusual features, but it is intuitive and although I shouldn't say this, you really don't need the manual,  So, here are the pros and cons:PROs- 12 cups - Nice, but make sure you purchase the larger size filters. The smaller 4 cup filters just won't work very well.- Two hour shut off - a must for a coffee make that is designed to keep the java warm for a while. If you forget it, the coffee might not taste very good as the water evaporates, but it won't stay on long enough to crack the carafe or cause a fire.- Brew strength options - I haven't tried this yet and  have always just used a little more coffee to make it stronger, but this feature could save you some money over the long haul - very long haul.- Programmable for a timed start - essential for those of us who like to wake up to the aroma of brewing coffee.CONs- This model comes with a water filter that fits on top of the grinds basket and filters the minerals coming in from the ""showerhead spout."" The manual recommends that the filter be changed monthly.  I have never had a problem with hard water, although I use a water filter on the kitchen sink.  Unless you have really foul water, and then again this might not help, I suggest that this is a totally frivolous feature that is designed to get you to trot out to the store and buy more filter replacements since it is recommended that the filter be changed every 30 brews or monthly..  Fortunately, the coffee maker does not require this.  You can make the coffee without using this filter.- The unit also has a built in sensor that determines whether you are using a glass carafe (provided) or a thermal carafe.  I imagine that the metal skin of the thermal carafe triggers a magnetic switch which prevents the warming tray from going on.  I actually bought this unit because I was unhappy with the Mr. Coffee thermal carafe unit I had been using, since it was more difficult to clean than the glass, and the coffee was never really hot enough.All in all, it's a nice coffee maker, but I think these extra features have to add something to the price.  I can't help but wonder how much less it would have cost without the water filter and the carafe sensor.Since both of these features are optional, I was tempted to give the unit FIVE stars, but I feel a little annoyed that the manufacturer is trying to put something over on us. Just my opinion.  As John Galt says, ""Value for value.""  If the price is acceptable to you, then it's FIVE stars.Get the bagels and coffee cake ready.  Breakfast is served."
ArmyVet62,4.0,"June 3, 2020",I have purchased this coffee maker twice. First on December 2013 and it worked great. Lasted until March 2019 and It was fine for the first 8 months but I've had problems with it for the last 6 months or so. I've cleaned it twice but still problems. I was about to purchase another one until I saw that I've only had it 14 months so I will not be purchasing. The problem with this item is the basket. The spring which allows the coffee to flow into the pot is not working properly. I don't really want to blame Amazon for this but now I am going to need to get a replacement basket directly from the manufacturer and this coffee maker wasn't exactly cheap 😟
Ann Emerick,3.0,"June 28, 2021","The coffee maker was used and  listed as like new, chrome front was badly stained and will not come clean. Disappointed as it was not that much off regular price. works fine, except it beeps as coffee starting to brew, not when it is finished brewing.  This is not a problem for us, however again it was listed as like new. It Replaced the same brand/style so we knew what to expect. Makes good coffee. I took off 2 stars for the misinformation on purchase."
Nick E.,5.0,"August 5, 2016","I'd say I'm a normal coffee drinker. This makes me coffee every morning and does a great job. I have had zero complaints about this machine. I don't expect it to last forever, but I also only paid $30 for it. So far its been working great, I actually am planning on buying one for my wife so she can bring it to work with her. I have the thermal pot as well which does a great job, but the glass is the normal day to day work horse.I do buy the filters ($7.75 for an 12 pack) just because I don't like our city water much, and they seem to do the job alright, I notice when I don't use them.Overall, I'd say when you compare to a $20 coffee pot that can do the same work as this one, the little add-on's this has is worth the extra $10. I don't know what else I expect it to do other than keep correct time and go off every morning so I can come out of the shower to a fresh pot of coffee, and it does that well. 5 stars for doing exactly as expected!Edit: it's almost 2019... It's still being used daily. The heating pad is looking a bit rusty but hasn't affected performance in the slightest."
Renee M. Winterbauer,5.0,"June 30, 2021","Since our purchase of this coffee pot 2016, Mr. Coffee Pot is still going strong!  we make 1 pot of coffee a day (rain or shine).  This coffee pot is simple to use.  We are surprised that the coffee maker still has the new look to it and nothing has tarnished or worn out.  We clean it fairly often too.  The hot plate is slightly worn but does not affect performance and is not noticeable unless you remove the pot.  Important to note: For us, we do make the coffee and turn off the coffee about 15 minutes after brewing and remove the coffee grounds.  Just a habit since we don't like to leave electrical items unattended if we are not in the room.  We have owned more elaborate and expensive coffee pots that usually stop working after a year or two or repeated use.  This coffee pot has saved considerable cost of replacement!"
Pamela Audeen  Poddany,5.0,"January 12, 2015","MR. COFFEE 12-CUP PROGRAMMABLE COFFEEMAKER, CHROMEIt was time for us to purchase another coffeemaker and having one of these currently, we decided to purchase another one just like it.  My hubby drinks decaf only and I drink 'real' coffee, so for us, having two coffeemakers is a must.You can't go wrong with the MR. COFFEE 12-CUP coffeemaker.  There are so many great things about this unit --Looks great sitting on your kitchen counterPause control -- can't wait?  Remove the pot and the brewing will stop so you can pour your coffee NOWAutomatically shuts off after being on for two hours -- beeps when shutting offAfter coffee is brewed and is ready to enjoy, a beep sounds to get your attentionRemovable filter basket for easy disposal of grounds and cleaningNice and clear water window on the side for easy fillingCord storage in the back so you may hide that unsightly cordBrew strength available from regular to strong blendMy only quibble would be that the digital clock is somewhat hard to read.This particular coffeemaker has won BEST in the category for three years -- 2011 - 2012 - 2013.  The carafe is available in thermal or glass and the unit is self-cleaning.  We use good old white vinegar and this works well.If you are in need of a new coffeemaker, this is the one for you.  Not only does the coffee taste wonderful, rich, hot, fresh, and delicious each time, but the coffeemaker itself is attractive and you can' beat the price,  Start your day off the right way with a superb cup of coffee brewed in your new Mr. Coffee.Thank you."
Rye Nienke,5.0,"December 23, 2014","Now that I've had this for a year and more than 100 uses I figured I would get a review in.I haven't had a single issue with this coffee maker that wasn't user error. It plainly works and works well.I initially bought this based on good reviews and the ability to get a thermal carafe at some point, though I have yet to make that jump as the coffee is usually gone before it starts to cool down too much.The water filter was good for about a month, and I haven't replaced it since, I just use the maker without it and have had no issues. The water where I live isn't hard or soft, so there's no real need for filtering. The filter is just a carbon filter which would remove little more than odor or taste from the water. I didn't see it as useful unless you had issues with your water.It looks decent on the countertop, and doesn't take up too much room. The lid is a bit cumbersome as it is quite large and can't be opened under my cabinets, but it's really a non-issue as it is easy to move around.If it stopped working today I would buy another without hesitation, but it's so simple I doubt that it will go wrong before several years of use."
Scared Guy,2.0,"June 20, 2017","Like the machine, like the coffee, however after 14 months it just stopped brewing.  Everything lights up, but it does nothing.  Doing research, I see that this is a very common problem, many instances of exact same problem listed in Amazon reviews.  So I called the help number to see if 'Mr Coffee' cared, bottom line...no really they do not care.  Will gladly sell my another machine at full price, but they also admit they have not addressed this problem, and cannot say it would not happen again.  So please avoid this and any other Mr Coffee products."
Brad,1.0,"February 1, 2017","This is a pretty decent coffee maker for the price you pay. However, I have to rate 2/5 because of an issue I've been having since I got this. Every once in a while, the coffee grounds get all over the place and into the coffee pot itself. This isn't caused by a poorly placed coffee filter in the cup, nor is it from overloading it with coffee grounds. Everything is as neat and in place as it should be, but it still makes a mess. It has also managed to put the coffee everywhere but in the pot, which is strange beyond belief. I'm not sure what causes all these issues, but I think I may look for a different one.UPDATE JUL. 5, 2017: Down to one star now since it burnt itself out. It turns on but doesn't heat up/brew. There are cheaper products that last much longer. I got this half a year ago, so this model is not the most reliable."
BEC,4.0,"February 28, 2014","We've been using Mr Coffee makers for years now. They make good coffee, keep it hot, don't cost too much and are, for us the best value on the market. We stepped up a level for this one because the Amazon price was right. We normally don't go for the fancy features. All we need is auto shut off.Anyhow, this pot works great. Surprisingly, the ""stronger"" setting actually works. What is does, I have no idea, but the coffee tastes stronger when we use the setting. The machine is attractive and easy to use.Just some quibbles:The lid for accessing the coffee holder and water reservoir opens to the side, instead of front to back. This requires pulling the machine further out on the counter and turning it, which sometimes pulls out the plug. Annoying.Another effect of this opening style is that it's more difficult to pour water into the machine, especially for a lefty, than with our earlier, simpler machines.These are really minor quibbles, but hey, that's what a review is for."
Rich C,1.0,"August 7, 2015","I tried two of these devices and both have the same design defect. The coffee basket has only one point of support (shower head) to hold down the coffee basket. Because of this issue, the basket raises up when the decanter is placed into the machine. The reason for this is that the basket's valve (at the bottom) is spring loaded and the top of the decanter pushes the basket up rather that opening the spring loaded valve. If the manufacturer simply put a tongue in groove tab at the front of the basket so that this point is held firmly in place, then possibly the shower head can hold the back side of the basket in place. Even that solution though requires that there is a tighter fit between the shower head and the basket. As a confirmation to my premise, I was able to easily rig the basket to stay in place by using two spring clips, one in front & one at the rear of the basket. I sent both devices back though because the product should never have been placed on the market in this state."
Dawn M.,5.0,"March 1, 2015","It's a coffee maker.  Not rocket science here.  I had a Keurig that bit the dust after a year and a half, and when I took it apart to try some of the on-line trouble-shooting suggestions, I couldn't get it back together.  But I'm a serious addict, and have to have my coffee, so I did the usual on-line research to see which was the best cup of coffee for the money.  I like this unit a lot.  If anything I'm drinking more coffee than I used to, so I'm spending more in that regard, but while that's in part this coffee maker's fault, how bad can it be that your coffee maker makes such a good cup that you want more?  I don't know - you be the judge.  But I like the coffee better than the coffee I got out of my Keurig.  I didn't bother with the metal insulated carafe - the two hours of heating is plenty for my purposes.  I like the extra filtration of the water, although I haven't had to replace that filter yet so I don't know how much that costs - I think it's around $6, and the units apparently are recommended to be changed every 2-3 months, since mine came in January or February (I can't recall, honestly) and ""April"" was already set on the filter frame for me.  I also like the ""strong brew"" setting - never could get a rich-enough cup out of the Keurig no matter how much coffee I tried to pack into the K-cup basket, and this is a nice option on this unit.  Haven't tried all the pre-programming features - I really like fresh-ground beans and fresh water, so I probably never will use that feature anyway.  Nice cup of coffee though - great unit for the money."
Phil,5.0,"April 12, 2012","For the past 4 years, we've used a Cuisinart DCC-1200 that has been okay, as long as I would dismantle it (twice) to adjust the contacts on the on/off switch. The unit would turn off during a brew cycle due to a faulty switch connection. We decided to pass on getting a replacement unit and settled on this Mr Coffee model, mostly based on the high rating in Consumers Reports. After reading some of the reviews here on Amazon, I wondered if it would be a wise decision, as no one wants their coffee leaking from the decanter onto the floor or counter top or smelling like burnt plastic.Those who complained about the leaking problem are either putting out a scam review, or they have a different model than the one we received. I tested the glass decanter, and there was NO WAY I could get it to drip over the side. It poured directly into the cup with no dribbling. I tried pouring it very slowly and could not get it to run down the side of the decanter. One reviewer said she had to 'lift the cheap plastic lid' in order to pour the coffee. Well, I don't know where that bit of info came from, but the lid is not cheap plastic, and you don't have to lift it at all.....hmmmm.We ordered the optional thermal decanter and it is very solid. It has an 8 cup capacity and has no pouring issues either.The coffee quality is as good as your water and coffee can provide. It brews quickly and gives you a hot cup of coffee, at the right temperature. I did not detect any off-tastes due to plastic. I did smell a bit of plastic during the first brewing, but this is normal for new appliances that are heated. The plastic is 'off-gassing' some of the volatiles and this should subside after a few uses.The unit is very well-designed and looks great on our counter. It is actually shorter than the Cuisinart model and that is a plus for us. The controls are great and easy to use. Setting the clock is intuitive, and programming it for a delayed brew is very easy. It is also a 'smart' unit, in that it senses when you are using the thermal decanter, and automatically turns off the hot plate under the decanter. It also has a button that lets you see how long it has been since the coffee was brewed. As far as I can tell, it will heat the glass decanter for 2 hours, before it beeps 3 times, then shuts off. With the metal decanter, the unit shuts off immediately after brewing (no lights are on). The LCD showing the time is easy to read, but you need to bend over to see it. The instruction manual says there is a red light that will light when it's time to clean the unit, but I can't find this light anywhere.The unit is easy to fill and the water level can be seen easily in the gauge on the right rear. If you need a cup of coffee before it is finished brewing, you can pull the decanter away, and it gives you 30 seconds to pour a cup, then replace the decanter. I detected no leakage of coffee when I did this (contrary to what some other reviewers have claimed).Make sure you have some basket-type coffee filters (not cones), or have ordered the optional permanent filter basket, since these are not provided with the unit.The unit also has a water filter and holder that fits over the basket and under the water 'shower head'. I'm not sure this is a good design for the filter, since it is another item you need to install before every pot, then clean afterwards. The Cuisinart had a drop-in water filter, that worked before the water entered the brewer. I like this better. We don't use any filters since we use filtered water from the fridge.All-in-all, this is a great coffee maker at a very decent price. The option to get a thermal decanter for it is a big plus for us, as we will be pouring less coffee down the drain in the future.  I expect to get many good pots of coffee from this coffeemaker. If I find otherwise, I will update this review."
"Not A Lot Of Money ""Mom""",4.0,"April 7, 2015","Replaced my former Mr. Coffee maker with this one when the other one just decided it wasn't going to make coffee anymore, suddenly.  I like the sleek design of this one better. Coffee is really hot when done, which is a MUST for my husband. You can adjust the strength of the coffee too.  It really makes the perfect pot of coffee and my husband likes that you can turn on the signal that beeps to let you know the coffee is done so you'll know to come and get it.  No need to keep checking, if you're in another room.  We have a permanent mesh (washable) filter which I always like much more than the paper ones.  No chance of coffee grinds skipping over a paper filter that is not inserted just ""exactly"" perfectly.  And, again, it's a really nice design to the unit itself.  I also like that it's not a glossy black finish.  My prior one was and it showed smudges and fingerprints a lot.  This one doesn't.  Easy to just wipe the exterior casing with a damp or dry cloth.Can't think of any negatives EXCEPT a couple of incidental ones, which took away one star. With my prior coffee maker, the ""cleaning cycle"" was easier. If you're not familiar with this, it is advised/suggested that you clean your coffee maker's coffee making parts at suggested intervals to remove mineral deposits which can damage your machine. With my former Mr. Coffee machine, you put the specified amount of vinegar (or separately bought cleaning solution made for this purpose) in the water well and it would process the initial amount of the vinegar and then ""sit"" for the specific time required for the cleaning cycle to do it's thing and then automatically release the rest of the vinegar through the system at the appropriate time.  THIS one doesn't do that.  It does have a clean cycle but, after putting in the vinegar, you must manually dispense X amount of the cleaning solution (i.e. vinegar) then stop the coffee maker for the specified time and then, again, manually start the dispensing of the vinegar again until it all runs through the unit.  This means you must be looking at the clock while cleaning this unit to determine when to do what.  The prior one did it on it's own.  All I needed to do was (as with this one), follow up with brewing full pots of WATER a couple of times then, to make sure all the vinegar is rinsed out.  Not a big deal to do. Also, I don't know what's with the ""pot"". We wash it but it stains from the coffee anyway.  Wonder if it's a glass mixture, if there is such a thing. When I first noticed the light staining/slight discoloration of the coffee pot, I noticed then that the ""glass"" didn't feel totally like glass.  I'm afraid to scrub the pot for fear of scratching it. We KNOW the pot's clean because we know we've washed it so, for us it's not a big deal but I'd be embarrassed if I had someone over for coffee and they saw that it looks like we just emptied the coffee out, and made another pot without cleaning the pot. When it goes through the cleaning cycle, these discolorations disappear but, I'm not going to soak the pot in vinegar every night! It's not really dark staining or discolorations so please don't let that stop you from buying this.  Or, maybe it's just the pot that I got.BUT, really, all in all, the discoloration of the pot is a minor thing.  And, the different ""clean cycle"" is a minor thing.  If something happened to this one and I needed to buy another one, I'd buy this one again!  What's most important is if it makes a good pot of coffee and this one does! We use regular, canned coffee and this brewer does a good job with it.  And, it's a HOT pot of coffee -- some coffee makers lack that and initially serve mildly hot coffee, until it heats more while sitting there.  I've tried various coffee makers.  This one's really good at doing what it's supposed to do."
Jacqueline C,1.0,"December 28, 2018","I've had this coffee pot for about 2 years and the clock stopped working, so delay brew is no longer an option.  I asked a parts company if they had a replacement part for that, they told me to check with the manufacturer.  When I contacted the manufacturer to obtain the part, their reply was, ""Our staff has read your question and values your contribution even though it did not meet all our website guidelines. Thanks for sharing, and we hope to publish next time!""  What a RIP OFF!!!  I've never had a manufacturer that didn't want you to love their product.  They clearly don't stand by their products and don't give a crap how long it lasts and want you to continue buying their poop every couple of years...fill up those landfills!"
J. E. N.,1.0,"February 21, 2014","I read a lot of reviews and for the money this seemed like a good choice. It's easy to use and I like the functionality (timers, settings) but I have 3 main issues with this machine.1) I've noticed that if I get a cup right when it's done brewing the coffee it is not hot enough. I have to put my cup in the microwave for 30 seconds. Once it sits on the warmer for a while it does get hot so I just set the timer to make the coffee earlier than I need it. 2) Before I got the gold mesh basket and was just using a paper filter, often, even though I put a full carafe of water into the reservoir I'd only get about a half pot of finished coffee. I discovered that the water was backing up into the machine and realized that the basket with the filter and coffee grounds did not have enough weight (or something) to push the spring down to open the bottom of the basket so the water could drain into the pot. It was a mess! I thought I was going to have to send it back but once I got the gold mesh filter the coffee maker has worked like it is supposed to. The coffee maker's basket does not lock into place like other coffee makers I have owned so if there is not enough pressure in the basket the liquid can't exit through the bottom.3) This coffee make is noisy and VERY slow. The first time I used it I set it to come on 30 min before I had to get up. I was awakened by what sounded like someone breaking into my house... scared me to death. I got up only to discover it was the coffee maker. It takes this coffeemaker a good 15+ min to make a full pot of coffee...very slow by comparison of other makers I've owned.I've worked around the issues I've had with this machine but I wouldn't buy another one or recommend this one to anyone.Been using this coffee maker almost a year now. Broke the glass carafe last week so tried to order a replacement... Mr. Coffee doesn't make a glass replacement. There is a stainless steel thermos which is more expensive and doesn't hold 12 cups. I ordered a universal fit 12 cup carafe which says it fits my coffee machine but it did not. Perhaps if I had kept the top to the carafe I broke I might have been able to make the replacement carafe work. I can't believe I'll have to buy a new coffee maker just because I broke the glass carafe. One more reason I won't buy another Mr. Coffee anything!"
TexasAgain,4.0,"January 30, 2014","Quiet, quick, fairly easy to use.Button panel is a bit crowded, but I do like that it beeps when the coffee is done.  The taste of coffee is okay; I am not a coffee expert, so I can't elaborate more than to say I find the taste okay and my husband likes it a bit more than I do.The big DOWNSIDE to this is its carafe.  The plastic handle & lid seem cheap and hollow.  The lightweight handle is ill-positioned and causes the center of gravity to be misplaced.  It simply does not balance well in my hand when the pot is full.8 month update:Coffee maker is dying.  In the past couple of days, it has refused to let me manually turn it off.  I usually turn it off after brewing to keep the coffee from burning on the hot plate.  Now, it flashes 2 or 3 lights but won't turn off.  We had to unplug it.  Last night, it only brewed 10 of 12 cups.Upside -- Customer Service at Mr. Coffee is GREAT.  The rep immediately diagnosed the problem and is sending out a replacement coffee maker.  She asked if the machine has been releasing more steam than usual; it has.  It turns out that even the build up of condensation in the clock is a symptom of its problem.  There is an issue with the heating element malfunctioning.  She couldn't say exactly what went wrong with the element, but was able to diagnose it sufficiently to warrant sending us a new one.  She said it would likely completely stop working in the next week, so we called just in time!2nd UPDATE:  2 days after I called customer service, the coffee maker died entirely.  We haven't received a shipping notice, so we may have 2 to 3 weeks before the new coffee maker arrives.  I think I will buy another brand and keep the replacement Mr. Coffee as spare.So, although I wouldn't repurchase this particular item, I would consider another Mr. Coffee in the future, since their customer service is so great, if the ratings are high enough."
Chris F,4.0,"March 5, 2014","Like a number of other recent reviews, my first Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT unit had the issue that if you selected the ""Strong"" brew strength, the unit would sound the end-of-brewing cycle '3-beeps' about 45 seconds into starting the pot of coffee and not brewing after that (had to turn unit off and back on using ""Regular"" strength setting to complete brewing).  This happened with both the Glass and Thermal carafes.I called Mr. Coffee and their customer service was outstanding.  The person I spoke to was incredibly quick to understand the issue, offered to send a replacement of the same type of machine, or a different machine if I wanted.  She knew that the issue I had has something they are seeing in current production and sent me a return label for the machine so it could go to their quality control dept. to examine.  She made it clear that I should keep all the filter, brew basket, and carafe as spares - they just wanted the unit back for analysis.Well, the new unit works perfectly.  It even seems to make slightly hotter coffee (measured just over 190F in the carafe for a freshly brewed pot), which is about 5 degrees warmer than previously - and enough to notice the difference.I use whole bean dark roasts and the quality of the brewed coffee has been excellent with this coffee maker.  I'm happy to have the brew strength working as well now, but the ""regular"" setting also made very good coffee.  I also purchased the optional Thermal Carafe, which is very well made and provides a nice option when I want to use it.A decent looking and good performing coffee maker if you don't get a defective one.  If you do get a defective one, Mr. Coffee's customer service seems to be excellent (which is very hard to find today)."
Michael R. Smith,5.0,"July 21, 2014","All right, here’s the thing:  my wife and I live in a lakeside cottage that we love . . . but . . . it’s so small that when something new comes in like, for example, our new Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Chrome, something has to go out.  Where it goes to initially at least is the storage shed behind our home.  Over time, that storage shed fills up and things have to go out of it.  Where they go is to the dumpster. The latest thing relocated to the storage shed is our old Hamilton Beach coffee maker.  We named it Mr. Grumpy because it made so much noise it frightened guests, little children, and birds and animals.  You’ve already guessed that Mr. Grumpy will be relocated to the dumpster soon. Truth be told, I never trusted that Hamilton Beach.  The first time I cranked it up, it began growling away and promptly spewed the coffee grounds, coffee water, everything, all over the kitchen counter, walls, and floor.  From then till the very day it was relocated, I would do a head-jerk toward it midway through the brewing cycle to see if it was behaving itself. Now the Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Chrome, on the other hand, doesn’t growl.  It’s so nice and quiet, I hardly know it’s on.  A soft little sound alerts me when the brewing cycle is complete.  The coffee grounds and water stay right where they should.  And get this – the glass decanter doesn’t spill water when you fill up the water reservoir or when you pour coffee into a cup.  Nice!  There’s a water filtration system that requires the purchase of filtration filters.  We’ve tried coffee with and without the system and can’t taste the difference.  Two hours after the brewing cycle the unit automatically shuts off.  No worries there.  Like all gadgets now it has a clock.  You can delay the brewing if you want to.  You can select the brewing strength; regular or strong.  Plus, Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Chrome, is actually attractive.  All of that for less than forty bucks.  Very nice!! It will probably be a long time before the Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Chrome, is relocated to the storage shed."
Zanzarista,4.0,"October 6, 2013","This product was shipped to us in the manufacturers box, with all the pretty printing on the outside, so ALL the neighbors knew we had a new coffee maker.The water filler for this has exceptionally easy access, the entire lid opens to add the water. The gauge on the side of the product is relatively accurate for the number of cups you get.  Either I like weaker coffee or I've not been adding enough grounds, but the suggested number of scoops in the instructions for a given pot size, is more than I've used in the past. The one touch brew is a nice to have.The one thing that I learned the hard way is that the basket that holds the grounds, needs to be aligned to the locating groove inside the coffee maker when reinserted after cleaning.  Not observing this alignment, causes the basket to be misaligned with the coffee pot below.  Here is what happens: The pot presses up slightly on a valve that allows coffee to flow from the grounds basket, into the hole in the top of the pot.  If this valve in the basket is not depressed (raised in relation to the pot), the grounds basket has no where to allow the hot steaming coffee to go during brewing, and coffee and grounds will flow over the top of the basket an then down around the pot!!  You only do that once....  Haven't tried the delayed timer, but it's a personal thing about heater elements coming on when I'm not in the room, nothing to do with the coffee maker. Consumer reports likes this coffee maker too, that's what got me looking at it after our other one died."
Buford,5.0,"March 17, 2014","Our Cuisinart coffee maker had started to misbehave-it turned itself off spontaneously when coffee was supposed to be warming on the burner, etc.  At first I thought a circuit breaker had popped. Not the case. We would move it to another outlet in the kitchen and it would turn back on, so we thought it was the outlet. My husband changed the outlet. That did not solve the intermittent issue. So I started looking for another coffee maker. I was alarmed to find that many people were complaining that their Cuisinart caught on fire. Then I looked at Bunn. I liked that because it was made in USA (?) People who had used Bunn for years were complaining bitterly about the recent models, saying they leaked all over their kitchen counter. It is supposed to be a bragging point that the coffee is done in 3 minutes? Sorry, I would rather have cowboy coffee than weak coffee that is brewed in 3 minutes.  Finally I got PO'd and just ordered this Mr. Coffee, which cost about $35, and I had free shipping with Amazon Prime.  I LOVE THIS COFFEEPOT. We have used it several days now- I bought the permanent filter, have just ordered 2 more so I can just put them in the top rack of the dishwasher. It has a setting for regular or strong coffee- so I'm kind of getting my cowboy coffee after all. I used to believe you get what you pay for. Perhaps I was wrong; this Mr. Coffee was about 1/3 the price of some of the high-falutent coffee makers I shopped for, and I just LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it.  It has a sleek look and is very attractive on my granite, as well as working great!"
Nic in CT,2.0,"July 9, 2016","Have used this coffee maker about eight times and twice the water and grounds have overflowed and made a terrible mess, with a small amount of muddy coffee ending up in the carafe. After the first time, we thought it might be because the charcoal filter wasn't used, but the instructions don't indicate you must use it. The second time, we had used the filter and could only guess that it happened because the carafe wasn't seated exactly in place (it was definitely fully on the warming plate, though). We want to use it to auto-brew in the mornings, so not knowing if it's going to overflow and make a mess is extra-troubling. Also, it looks like it should have come with a removable permanent mesh filter basket, but it did not. I bought it a few months before we started using it, so I feel I can't return it at this late date, but I would have had we used it sooner! I would not recommend this product to anyone. Very disappointed, as we have had Mr. Coffee Makers in the past that were great, especially for the money."
Michael Cox,3.0,"October 19, 2014","My name is Michael, and I'm a coffee addict.Coffee-wise, this coffeemaker is everything that ""major consumer magazine"" says it is - it heats the water HOT, its ""strong"" option is handy (although I wish it was the default) and it looks kinda stylish. For $40 or less, you can't get a better cup of coffee.That said, there are a couple of issues with the Mr. Coffee (""BVMC-SJX33GT"" seems so formal) that you'll want to know before you buy.The primary problem is the seating of the filter basket. It's atrocious. There's nothing to hold it firmly in place, so it ""floats"" as you remove and replace the carafe, even with the lid closed. It also has a spring-mounted ""drip stop"" plug, which is supposed to stop the coffee from flowing when you remove the carafe. Of course, as in all coffeemakers, the coffee is still actually brewing, and you need to replace the carafe in a reasonable amount of time or the filter will overflow.BUT because the filter basket in the Mr. Coffee is not firmly held down, you must make sure the carafe is COMPLETELY seated under it. If you quickly put the carafe under the basket but don't manage to push it all the way back, the plug stays closed and you will return to coffee and grounds on the counter, on the floor, and in every nook and cranny of the coffeemaker itself. Waking up to that will NOT make your day. I've only managed to do that twice in the nearly one year that I've owned it, but I still have to make the conscious effort to push the carafe all the way in, because the one time I don't think about it -- coffee everywhere.But think of it this way: even with the hour of my time I've spent cleaning up after this, I'm still ahead of the $300 I'd have paid for a Technivorm.The other issue is minor but also design-related: condensation on the bottom of the lid. When I flip it up, all the condensation runs back into the filter basket and reservoir (the latter means more frequent cleaning).If the basket and lid were designed better, this would be a 5-star coffeemaker and there would be no reason for a sane person to even consider anything more expensive. But as it stands, for some people its flaws will outweigh the great coffee it's capable of making."
Ann,4.0,"January 13, 2014","I am satisfied with this coffeemaker, but it took about 10 days of using it to finally get the coffee at the strength and flavor I wanted.  I prefer a medium to strong coffee with no bitterness, and following the manufacturer's recommendations resulted in very weak coffee.  I tried several types and grinds of coffee as well.  For an 8 cup pot (40 oz. with this model) I now use a slightly rounded 1/3 cup of finely ground coffee for what I consider a good cup of coffee.There is a brew adjustment feature which allows you to make regular or strong brew.  On the ""regular"" cycle, the coffee is made very quickly, but the resulting coffee seemed quite weak.  If you prefer a stronger brew, be certain to use this feature.The delay brew feature is handy when you want your coffee ready first thing in the morning.  The controls are easy to use.  There are indicator lights of the front panel as well as a digital clock.  However, the clock and the functions are not lighted so I don't find them very helpful and they can't be read in the dark.This coffeemaker comes with a water filter, which is a simple disc that you insert in a plastic ring and put on top of the coffee filter housing.  The recommendation is to change it monthly, however I don't have a problem with tap water, so I don't plan to purchase filters or use them at this time.I use generic 10-12 cup paper filters for the coffee and have not been able to locate Mr. Coffee brand in any local stores, so I don't think it matters which brand filter you use.This coffeemaker comes with the option of a stainless steel carafe.  The unit is fairly large (big shoe box) but it is stable on the counter.  All things considered, this makes a decent cup of coffee after experimenting with the proportion of coffee to water."
J. Ochlek,1.0,"January 20, 2014",">>>UPDATED REVIEW>>> I gave an excellent review about this product a few weeks ago, because everything was working fine. But now I have to give it one star because this coffee maker stopped working altogether, it died, completely, completely dead, no clock, no lights, no brewing, no nothing, just an empty dead plastic carcass. We have been using it a few times a week to brew 6 cups of coffee per day, it's on the kitchen counter and it has been used in a careful, responsible manner following all the manual instructions, so, there's no reason whatsoever for this appliance to break this way. I called the 1800 MR COFFEE number, after 3 attempts and talking to 3 different people I finally got my warranty recognized and they will be sending me a new one in the next week. I'm really hoping I don't have the same problems again, but because it's under warranty I'll give it a try and see how it works. If it stops working again and dies, I'll just get rid of it and buy a different brand. Crossing my fingers :)----OLD REVIEW:I love this coffee maker, I didn't get any of the problems with the ""plastic odor"" some users have been writing about. After reading the instructions on how to clean it and running a whole cycle just with water I started using it right away and it made a great coffee. Very easy to use (please, read the instructions before complaining on how this or that doesn't work) and easier to clean, it looks stylish and beautiful and it works really fast!, I was used to my old coffee maker, and it used to take twice the time to brew some coffee, this one brews it in few minutes and a beep tells you when it's done. I love everything about this piece, and I will definitely buy it again in the future, for me or as a present, because the price is also excellent. I been reading some of the complaints about how to use this piece and most of those problems can get easily fixed by reading the instructions first. There's also tutorials in YouTube if you prefer. Five stars for this coffee maker."
Dober,2.0,"October 21, 2018",We have been buying these for years but I guess like many things they don't make them like they used to. This one only lasted 2 months. We brew one pot per day. Today the lights came on but would not brew. Time to try a different manufacturer
marymorstan,5.0,"May 26, 2016","Coffee Maker would have had a 5-star, except it died after 8 months. (Heating element just stopped working.) I will try having it repaired/replaced since it is still under warranty, but when I saw which company does repairs, I despaired. (I've dealt with this company before.) If I get a new coffemaker, I'll update review.  I've never had a product fail so quickly with simple day-to-day use and careful maintenance.UPDATE:  I did contact the Manufacturer.  Because it was under warranty, The company replaced the malfunctioning coffee maker with a new model, which has now worked beautifully for 2.5 years...Very impressed with Customer Service, and this is , IMO, the best, simplest, fastest coffee maker."
RG,5.0,"January 3, 2014","Cons: The lid flap on the top of the brewer opens to the left. I'm used to Mr. Coffee makers opening straight back, plus my kitchen cabinets are low/tall so I cant put it underneath them.I've had many coffee makers. I always end up buying a new one after a year, but this one tops the lot on awesomeness. I just hope it lasts longer than a year for as much as I'll use and most likely abuse it. Also, with any product, read the manual. If not how to make it work, but how to take care of it.Pros:-The lights. Kind of cheesy, but going from a Bella non-programmable to this beauty, I love the fancy schmancy colored lights.-The brew strength. Yeah, it only has two options, hardcore or meh, but my husband has acid reflux and the rare times I do share my coffee (lol) I try to brew it light. Otherwise, cool.-It came with a water filter thing. I bypassed using it as I use jugged spring water from the market, but I suppose if you have hard water and don't buy jugs of water this may be good.-The cute beeps! I read previous reviews stating the beeps are as loud as a laundry machine. I'm a housewife. I do laundry with my Cabrio series on loud. These beeps aren't loud. You'll hear them in the next room subtly, and if you put your ear up next to the machine yeah it's loud then. For me, if I'm doing dishes, the beep is perfect. Moving on..-Overall design. It's not too flamboyant, not too plain. Easy to clean. Sturdy."
AJR,1.0,"February 20, 2015","I didn't pay attention to the negative reviews, focusing on the positive ones and thinking that people just like to complain.  The design is beautiful and I really wanted to like this coffee maker but the comments about the OVERWHELMING PLASTIC SMELL are true.  At first, I figured that the smell was simply part of the manufacturing process and would come off after a few days.  I tried everything.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that I ran 2 vinegar brews, scrubbed the inside of the reservoir with vinegar (and on another occasion with vodka like one reviewer suggested), ran 5 hot water brews, left the lid open over night, ran another 3 hot water brews the following day and then 3 more the day after that.  I didn't notice the offensive plastic smell anymore so ON THE THIRD DAY I decided it was finally ok to brew my first pot of coffee.  Much to my dismay, the plastic smell reared its ugly head again and worse, I could taste it in the coffee.  Literally could not stomach it and had to toss the entire pot out.  Sorry, but appliances should be working properly from the moment you take them out of the box.  I went above and beyond to give this product a chance, but now strongly believe it's defective and needs to be redesigned with a different manufacturing process."
Sandy,2.0,"August 13, 2015","I have had this for a couple of months now and don't care for it. I bought it to replace my Bunn, which made the best coffee, until it finally wore out.  I bought this for the programmable feature, price, and based on Amazon reviews.PROS  Price, Programmable (but doesn't light up so it's annoying)  Water filter feature, ""Pause feature to get coffee while it's still brewing""CONS  Coffee doesn't taste nearly as good as my Bunn brewed it  Like other reviewers, there was a plastic/burnt taste that lasted for the first two months  Leaks from the bottom even though I put the carafe in properly  Water must be poured in the back, rather than the front. It's harder to do due to the cabinet above, and water ends up spilling  I end up with coffee grounds in my coffee  Inconsistent coffee temperatureI am disappointed in this machine. Bottom line is it has some annoying problems with the design and the coffee tastes mediocre."
KVF,4.0,"July 20, 2016","This is a solid coffeemaker and does what I need - drip coffee with a timer I can set the night before. I'm not too fancy with my coffee needs. I do like the digital display, though I imagine it could be hard to see in low light. It is easy to program the time and the timer. I like the brew strength option - I use less coffee this way. What I can't figure out is the plastic smell that it still gives off, even though I've used it for over a month. Before my first pot of coffee, I ran it with just water a few times to get the smell out, but that didn't work. So I made my first pot, and it tasted fine. When the coffee brews, it doesn't smell, but anytime I have to lift the lid for the reservoir, all I smell is plastic. Again, the coffee tastes perfectly fine. Just makes me wonder. I had my last Mr. Coffee coffeemaker for 10+ years, and it was a hand-me-down. Hopefully this one will stay with me awhile too."
RƋƑ,2.0,"September 12, 2016","When I first received this machine I was very pleased with it. It was only $25 back in February 2015. Yes, it is kind of a big block on your counter, but it made good coffee. I always thought the ""strong brew"" option on coffee machines was a gimmick, but it actually made a difference! I used it with my breakfast blends, for example just to eek out a little more richness.However, only having the machine for a little more than a year and daily brewing, it died in August 2016. I have had machines last for many years prior to this one. The warranty was only for one year so....Definition of ""it died"": Inexplicable leaking of water coming out of the tank from the bottom of the machine! What?!? This is evidence of poor craftsmanship and I expected better from Mr. Coffee. I would like my money back in any case.A year ago I would have highly recommended this product. Maybe this is just a defective one, but I would steer anyone away from this particular model."
Martegy,5.0,"January 19, 2014","After putting up with a drippy Kitchen Aid carafe for 2-3 years, I finally bit the bullet and bought this Mr. Coffee. It has all the same features as the more expensive coffee maker except:--Carafe doesn't drip. It's so nice to not have to hold my cup over the sink every time I pour a cup of coffee--Programmable timer is easy to figure out and use.--It looks good.Honestly, I looked and looked at more expensive coffee makers, but couldn't figure out the difference.Now what do I do with the Kitchen Aid coffee maker? It works fine, but if I donate it, some poor person will probably pay $15 for it, and they will be stuck with the drippy carafe. It's just so pointless. How hard is it to make a carafe that doesn't drip?My Mom told me back in the Eighties to buy a Mr. Coffee because a bunch of the other brands drip, but I got older and too big for my britches. I strayed. I had another fancy coffee maker that made great coffee for a few months. Then it started to taste awful and I realized that there were moldy coffee grounds in a part of the reservoir that could not be cleaned out. YUK. Then I tried the Kitchen Aid. I am still flabbergasted that Kitchen Aid can't design a carafe that pours without dripping. But never mind all that. Mr. Coffee took me back, and we are living happily ever after. So simple!"
enlkidd,1.0,"December 11, 2014","We have had this coffee maker for 14 months with no issues. We rely heavily on the delay brew function and love having the coffee freshly brewed hot and ready when we wake up. About a month ago we noticed the coffee began brewing earlier and earlier even though we had not changed the brew time. Upon further investigation we found that the problem was actually that the clock was gaining time. So every evening before bed we would adjust the time to correct it, this worked okay for a few days with the clock still gaining time but only a few minutes. Now the clock gains time randomly anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes overnight. Since the time is randomly gaining there is no way to predict a good brew time. So,if the delay brew function is used...it results in morning coffee that can be almost an hour old...not the same as fresh brewed! Now to ensure a fresh cup of coffee in the mornings we must manually start the machine. We spent the extra money for a programmable model....not a manual brew model. VERY Disappointed in this purchase!!"
Glenn,1.0,"January 4, 2016","Right off the bat this product ticked me off.The clock has no back light, and recessed a bit into machine making it extremely hard to read.  They have nerve making a product with out a lite clock so you can see it clearly :PThen I see it does not even come with a few paper filters or the permanent filter at all.  So now I have to go to store and try and find them or order them from here and wait a few more days.  I guess Walmart might carry them since they do sell this same coffee maker.It takes almost 8 minutes to make a 10 cup pot of coffee, this thing is really slow compared to other coffee makers I have had.Also has others have said this coffee maker has a very strong plastic smell.  I ran several pots of water through the machine and it still taste like plastic so I am returning it, this is a piece of junk."
W. Christian,3.0,"January 18, 2015","I bought this coffeemaker about six months ago. It stopped working a couple weeks ago. Until then I would have given this coffee maker five stars. It works well for the price. I looks pretty. It's easy to use. I like the features and the available thermal carafe, but I've never had a coffee maker die like that on me. In fact, every other coffee maker I've had, even the one my mom got for free with the purchase of a better coffee maker and gave me before college, have never actually stopped working. They just get so nasty and clogged (we have very hard water where I live) that buying a new one makes sense. This one didn't clog or get nasty. It just stopped working. The clock still worked, but that was it. I pressed all the buttons and nothing happened. I checked the fuses and switched it to various other plugs around the house. Nothing. It was done. I give it three stars because it did work pretty well until then and I feel like my incident might have been a one in a million sort of thing. After all, if they all broke this quickly there's no way this would be a best seller on Amazon. Word gets around here."
EC,3.0,"April 28, 2016","The new modern mr coffee look is nice. Making coffee isn't rocket science, but in the past two weeks I've managed to screw it up a few times because of the design of this machine. I took the advice to ditch the added water filter out since it doesn't sit right on the top. That was after I had coffee pouring all over my counter. Second time I didn't have the pot pushed back enough. It looked right but wasn't. Third and fourth times were when the inside basket looks like it's in snug but once the water pours in it floats making it like a little boat of coffee grinds getting everywhere except in the coffee pot. You have to be careful it's in the exactly way and then double check before using if. The cord is short on the counter which is good and bad. Pulling it towards you to open the top to fill the water and put coffee in has to be able to clear the counter and I usually have to unplug it. Kind of annoying. Price was right."
Mike,5.0,"September 22, 2013","I'll start by saying I'm no coffee expert. I just know I like my coffee to taste good and be hot enough that it needs a few minutes to cool off before I'm able to drink it. This coffee maker does the job. It's reasonably priced and makes good coffee. I do agree with some of the previous comments that there is a pretty strong plastic smell but this has dissipated with time. I would point out it never altered the taste of the coffee, but if this would bother keep looking. This is the first time we have used a coffee maker with a timer and love that when we get up coffee already made (old faithful started taking 30 minutes to brew one pot). The clock is not back lite so if you have to have that pass on this coffee maker. Set up and programming quick and easy. I would say not sure if the Brew Strength does anything. Seems to taste the same on regular or strong but taste great either way. If you just want great tasting coffee that might not be scalding but is hot enough you will have to wait a few minutes to drink it, this does a great job. Have only been using this a couple of months and don't expect to get 12 years like old faithful, but if it lasts a few years will have gotten my moneys worth and more."
Pierce C. West,4.0,"August 30, 2013","The new coffee maker arrives, and I set it on the counter to open the box. I have the box right side up according to the pictures on the box. The machine is securely protected with cardboard and foam to the point that I can not pull the machine out without cutting the box on one side. As I lift the plastic bag it is wrapped in, I see that the machine has been placed upside down in relation to the outside of the box, so I continue to pull the bag up, and then the carafe, which was placed into its appropriate place in the machine, but outside the plastic bag, and is upside down, therefore not resting on its bottom on a shelf, but is precariously on its top (and of course the carafe is on the away side from me, so I am not yet aware of all this) and as I pulled the bag a little further, this tightened the sides of the bag which caused the carafe to be ejected from its precarious position. The carafe landed on the floor, but fortunately did not break. This is just incompetent and completely dangerous as if the carafe had shattered, which I expected it to, someone could have been severely cut. The coffee maker should have been placed in an up position relative to the pictures on the box and the carafe should most certainly have been on the inside of the plastic packing bag."
K. Roman,1.0,"August 12, 2015","Received March 10th, The First month it would brew super fast and hot coffee and it beeped to let you know it was ready.  Flash forward to today and I had to email Mr/ Coffee because is beeped and had only brewed 2 cups?  It had been getting slower with time but this was the worst brewed pot yet almost 15 minutes.  I clean it monthly with vinegar and even if it is less expensive than other models I expect it to last at least a year. Very disappointed again.  Update:  12*6*2015 The second coffee maker that was replaced by Mr. Coffee would not turn on this morning was set like always for 6:45 and nothing unplugged  and tried manually nothing.....I am fuming its sunday morning and no coffee.  Will contact company again but i should not have too.....Frustrated in Florida"
Dianne Algiere,5.0,"September 19, 2016","I really like my new Mr. Coffee 12 cup coffeemaker.  This coffeemaker comes with a water filtration disc that goes into the top where you put the coffee and water in.  I set the clock so now I can just brew my coffee when I want to or I can set it to brew and have my coffee ready in the morning when I get up.  I can also set the brew strength of my coffee.  I could have bought one of the higher priced coffeemakers, but some of them do not have all the features that this coffeemaker has.  I would recommend this coffeemaker to everyone."
merryfl,1.0,"October 2, 2015","I used to use Krup coffee makers from Bed Bath and Beyond but got frustrated when they only lasted a little over a year. I started with this Mister Coffee instead because I love the looks of it. It makes OK coffee when needed but I use it mostly for heating water. Here is the track record for this model to date:9/11 gift from Costco--died 9/13 very good for a coffee pot used daily, but then all down hill9/13 from Walmart--died 7/14 not even a  year7/14 from Walmart--died 3/15 eight months--shorter and shorter3/15 from Amazon--died 9/15--not even six months.It has a 12 month warrantee. Laughable as the nearest service center is more than an hour awayI am going back to Bed Bath and Beyond. They don't carry this model but at least they will replace whatever I buy from them."
Michael J. Ferraro,4.0,"February 3, 2015","Been using this for a year. Very happy. We love coffee and for the price you can't beat this brewer. We were using a percolator and loved that as well, but they weren't reliable. This drip maker is ALMOST as good as the percolator. Way better than most drip machines, including some that are nearly $100. We also bought the thermal pot which is nice as well. But we prefer the glass pot that comes with it because the coffee stays much hotter. We like it strong, so the ""Strong"" setting is very nice. It takes about 10-12 minutes to brew a pot of ""strong"". We found the water filter disc to be pretty useless because we have great tap water in our town. I guess it would be more useful if you had yucky tap water. No big deal though, we just don't use the filter disc. We never experienced the ""plastic"" taste others have noted."
charley'slove,4.0,"February 28, 2012","As Consumer Reports said, this coffeemaker heats water to a higher and more ideal temperature to result in a more full-bodied cup of coffee, making it an especially good deal for the price. It also has built-in functional features, like a protrusion hanging from the lid that shoves the drip arm over the basket (should you forget) when you close the top. This means that you can only err with countertop drip/spills by not closing the top lid altogether. We particularly like the brew strength button that lets you pick ""strong"" over ""regular"" so that we can get the stout cups of coffee we like while using less grounds. While the boxy styling isn't up to par as compared to sleeker, more expensive models, you'll be very happy with your cup of joe as long as you don't need to put on airs. Only drawback is the glass carafe, which--particularly when full--drips from its odd-shaped spout when it pours. It also seems flimsier than most (thinner glass?), so we bought the accompanying thermal carafe to tide us over if and when this happens. Definitely a BEST BUY!"
Kar Dell,5.0,"January 14, 2014","We could not be happier with this coffee maker.  We replaced an aging Cuisinart with this Mr. Coffee.  While we loved the old coffee maker, the $100.00 cost was more than we wanted to spend to replace it.  This one fit the bill and with the high ratings here on Amazon and on Consumer Reports, we decided it was a good bet.It is easy to use.  Push a button and go.  Very easy to set up the clock and the delay start.  The coffee come out delicious.  I have to say I don't notice much if any difference between the Regular brew setting and the Strong brew settings in the taste of the coffee.The brew pause, which allows you to take a cup while it is still brewing, works well.  The Cuisinart would drip quite a bit but the seal on the Mr. Coffee seems to seal better and one drip or two is all you get after removing the pot.Though it says 12 cups, in practice you get about 11 after the coffee grinds absorb about a cup of water.  The Cuisinart, due to the shape of the basket, absorbed about a half cup less.  Not a big deal.All in all I would say this maker compares very favorably to the much more expensive maker from Cuisinart.Very pleased"
Wesley Smith,5.0,"February 28, 2015","start with I am not a barista,  but I enjoy good coffee.  I purchased the basket insert and use with a paper filter to slow the drip a bit more and filter out sediment. I also purchased the thermal stainless steel pot to go with the unit.  I suggest using the little water filter inserts.  We replaced a Cuisinart machine of similar function that died after about 2 years of daily use.  I like the look and operation of the Mr. Coffee much betterTo the coffee making:Pros:  from the first pot,  there was NO plastic taste;  you can select an longer drip option for stronger coffee which I like.  the countertop appearance is nice.  it beeps (not too loud) when finished brewing and then again when the pot automatically turns off (2 hours I think?) ;  the time setting and programming options are intuitive and work fine.Cons:  pouring water into the reservoir is a bit awkward;all-in-all -  a very reasonably priced value coffee maker that produces as good a cup of coffee as the beans you use."
S. Throop,3.0,"December 7, 2011","There are a couple of things I like about this coffee pot, but there are some that I don't like too.Pros: I like the look of it. I love the water filter, since we have water from a well and it isn't that great. The filter really helps a lot!! I like that you can make it strong without having to add extra grounds. I like that you can pour a cup before it is finished brewing and the water will not come out until you put the pot back on the burner. But we don't really do that very often.Cons: The MAIN thing I dislike is, they can put a man on the moon, but they can't make a coffee pot that doesn't dribble when you pour, and this pot is the worst I have ever owned!!! I litterly have to keep a towel next to the pot at all times to pour over or there is a mess!! Also the water well is very narrow and you really have to have a good aim. I would bring the pot over to the sink to use the hose to fill it, but the power cord on this pot is so short, you can barely move it from under a cabinet. I love that it has an automatic shut off, but 2 hours is just too soon for it to turn off. This would be great for someone to make a pot before work and not have to worry if they turned it off before leaving. But for someone not leaving the home every morning, it turns off way too soon and I have to heat my cup in the microwave quite often.Would I recommend this pot?  Probaly not. There has to be a pot somewhere that doesn't dribble, with a longer cord and a longer cycle before turning off!!  The pot from my old coffee maker didn't dribble. I sure wish it hadn't broke. THAT coffee maker I LOVED!!!"
AS,4.0,"November 22, 2013","Purchased July 2013 and we gave it 2 stars.  We up that to 4.  The smell is gone and this works very well for us.  It does keep the coffee hot and we did purchase the optional stainless steel 8 cup carafe.  Just ordered one for a gift.July 2013 Review We had a Mr. Coffee for many years.  It had the stainless steel carafe.  We order that extra for this.  It is a screwy set up on this.  The glass carafe is 12 cup.  The extra cost stainless steel carafe is 8 cup.  I cannot get the coffee maker to brew on the Strong setting if I use the stainless steel carafe.  Also, the strong plastic smell of the coffee maker (and the coffee) for the first two weeks.  Ewwwww.  We waisted a lot of coffee trying to get a pot that you could drink.  We also used vinegar and water several times trying to clean it and get rid of the taste.  Finally, we are drinking coffee.  It does an okay job, except for what I mentioned.  You load the eater from the side and we don't like that either.  That is where the water fill gauge is too.  We would have returned this if I would have been smart enough to save the packaging.  Mr. Coffee needs to do some thinking on their design and on the materials they use. I will not purchase another ... of course, I'm sure too that most of these are made 'from off' and are the cheapest materials, right?"
SeattleBookMama,5.0,"March 8, 2014","We hated the dinky four cup machine my spouse had received as a gift, and were delighted when it began to leak coffee all over the counter. Hurray! A legitimate reason to shop for a new machine. When I read the reviews for this one and saw the mark-down on the price, all notions of a fancier machine--even here in Seattle, the coffee mecca of the USA--were immediately abandoned.If you drink coffee from a mug, as most in the USA do, be aware that a cup does not fill a mug full of coffee. If you want to drink a couple of mugs full before leaving home and then fill up your commuter coffee cup, and allow for the chance that another less regular coffee drinker in the family may wander in and want coffee too, then you need a machine about this size.It is easy to set up, and offers the choice between strong coffee or regular. It also has a timer so that your coffee can greet you when you stagger out of bed at crazy-o'clock in the morning, but we have not tried that and can't report on it. All I know is that this is a good, sturdy machine with no glitches. Everything is easily accessed, and it makes good coffee. Best of all, we got it free with credit card points, but if we'd paid cash, I'd say the same.Buy it while you can!"
S. Hudson,4.0,"December 12, 2016","As an avid, nay obsessive, coffee drinker, I have to say this is the best coffee maker in the price range. After 2-years of continuous pots of java, I finally had to replace my old coffee maker (which was the exact same brand and model). A coffee maker that can last me 2-years is a unique experience for me. I have bought more expensive models and they quit working for me within a year.I read many of the other reviews. I have never smelled or tasted plastic past the first ""brew"" - clean water run through before using the first time. I did have a couple coffee messes until I realized how touchy the inner basket is. If it is not precisely in its little holder, the coffee will fill up the basket area then run all over the counter. The lid will go down even if it isn't placed correctly.PROS:- 2-hour timer- Ability to use a chrome carafe (sold separately)- Programmable (and it's easy)- Brew strength choice- Cheap price- Looks like an expensive coffee maker- Fits easily on the cabinet- Color matches my other small appliancesCONS- The top lid gets very hot while it's brewing- Wish the coffee was just a tad hotter- The hot plate corrodes quickly"
tenap,1.0,"February 12, 2016","Was a 5 star to begin with, now today, only a few months later it no longer works. Lights up (as you can see in the photo) but nothing else. On a good note though I contacted Mr. Coffee through Facebook and they are sending me a new one. After reading other reviews and comments on their page, it seems this particular model is known for ""crapping"" out! 😳"
Lisa Childress,5.0,"November 2, 2014","I've had this now for 6 months and my only complaint is that it keeps the coffee way too hot. I drink only 1 cup during the week but on the weekends I like to have two. The coffee is usually burned by the time I get back for my second cup so I keep it turned off and just heat the 2nd cup in the microwave. Shortly after I started using this coffee maker, I started noticing skin sloughing off on my bottom lip (gross, right?) and it didn't take long to realize it was because the coffee was so hot. I recommend adding a small piece of ice before taking your first sip.This is an update to my original post. I've been using my Mr. Coffee for over 4 years now and it's still doing a phenomenal job. I have no plans to replace it anytime soon (although I'd like to get a new carafe) and have decided that if and when I do have to get another, I'll definitely try another Mr. Coffee maker first and foremost. I'm not a morning person, to say the least. But it gives me a really great reason to wake up!!Oh, and the skin on my bottom lip must have become used to the heat because it doesn't slough off anymore. But the coffee is still REALLY hot....just the way I like!"
fred,5.0,"January 5, 2013","The Mr Coffee programmable coffee maker is great; it replaced a GE spacemaker coffee maker that died suddenly after years of use. The Mr Coffee, which I had to replace after 2 years, 3 months, with the same model, because it ceased heating/brewing. The product makes either 12 cups in a glass decanter or 8 cups in a stainless decanter and figures out which decanter is in use. It also offers delayed brewing and brewing strength selection; not only does it have a clock but also the time since the batch was brewed. However, it keeps the 12-cup batch warm for only two hours, unless the select button is pushed after each two hour heating period. The same time restriction applies for re-heating.  The optional stainless decanter keeps coffee hot for several hours if the air-tight lid is used, but it can't be re-heated on the warming plate. I drink coffee all day so constant use of the warming plate is desirable. The optional permanent filter basket is great; paper filters are not needed; just be sure to rest it inside the filter basket provided with the coffee maker. The other option I purchased is water filter packs, but I haven't used these long enough to properly judge whether they are really needed."
Still cold in the Capital area,4.0,"November 11, 2015","Pretty much just what you'd expect from a $30 drip coffee maker.I was, however, surprised by its appearance.  The chrome trim looks great, and it's a good size.  It's probably smaller than any other drip machine I've ever owned, so it's counter top footprint is minimal.  I'll probably end up getting the insulated thermos for it, mostly for aesthetics though.  It's too bad you sacrifice 4C of coffee in switching from the glass pot to the insulated thermos carafe.In terms of ""cons"" all I've noticed so far are:The clock isn't backlit, so it makes reading it trickyThe water filter just balances on top of the filter basket--which having to remove it to fill/empty the filter basket adds a step to each pot of coffee, and it takes a little practice to get the balancing act right.  More higher end Mr Coffee machines use a ""embedded"" type of filter which won't be so cumbersome during daily use.The machines beeps, like a microwave, when it's finished--which I suppose could be occasionally helpful, but I'll generally think it's annoying."
Tee Tommy,4.0,"January 19, 2017","Purchased this coffee maker in August, 2015. Stopped working today, 18 months later due to element failure. Get this, I ordered another one today. Apparently, the quality of the heating element is lacking but the features of this device are so convenient that I just had to have another one. I've owned several coffee makers including a high end Cuisinart but none as convenient as this model from Mr. Coffee. Even with the failure, I calculated that it cost me only $1.85 per month to have something that I like. Think about this, a single cup of coffee from Starbucks will cost more than that. So, all you naysayers in the reviews are missing out on the most convenient coffee maker on the market. Put things in perspective, a meal out will cost more than this coffee maker. True, it won't last forever but enjoy it and buy another when needed."
I. Ong,2.0,"March 2, 2016","I am two years into using this coffee maker and I must have received one of their lemons as described by Consumer Reports:  [...]  In a nutshell, CR magazine no longer recommends this coffeemaker because it no longer heats water reliably to the temperature required (195° to 205° F for five to six minutes) to nominally extract flavor from coffee grounds.  After its first month of usage, my coffee maker won't heat consistently.  Sometimes it's hot, other times it's lukewarm and I have to reheat it in the microwave.  The coffee doesn't taste the same day to day either, despite using a measuring spoon for the coffee and measuring cup for the water.  I never had this problem using  Braun, Oster and Hamilton Beach coffeemakers in the past 30 years."
KM,3.0,"January 28, 2014","I'd rate this 2 1/2 if I could.  I have to agree with some of the flaws noted by others.- ""Off"" taste after initial cleaning and a vinegar run-through upon opening.- Cord is TOO SHORT!  I either need to rearrange my appliances or use an extension cord.  It's not even long enough to place just to the left of my toaster oven.- The 'sleek, black' style may look nice, but makes filling the water tank and even seeing the carafe coffee level difficult.  Guess I need undercounter lights in addition to all if the recessed bright lighting in the kitchen.- What the HECK is the point of the spout?  It isn't mentioned at all in the manual, except to list it as a part, but you need to remember to move it out of the way to remove the basket, and then remember to position it back over basket to brew.- Clock isn't backlit which makes setting the timer a real P-I-T-A.I'll put up with some of the design inconveniences if a longer 'break-in' time gets the thing making flavorful coffee, but if not I'm sending it back.I'll update this review if I do."
Cerise0707,5.0,"December 16, 2013","We live in a city with horrible tasting water. The extra filter makes a HUGE difference in the taste of the coffee. This was purchased as an early Christmas gift for my husband, and I happened to catch it on sale. I saw no reason to buy the thermal carafe, as it only holds 8 cups of coffee, and he drinks 12 cups on his own pretty quickly.Our nearly four year old son loves all the lights and the fact that it beeps when it's finished. The coffeemaker looks very nice in our kitchen. The only possible con that I could think of is that because of the direction the lid opens, to pour water in the reservoir, we have to pull it out from under the cabinet. Older versions opened another direction, which made it easier to pour water into it. All that said, that's absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things, and certainly not enough to take it down a rating star.The coffeemaker shuts off after two hours, so you do not have to worry about it burning the coffee. The carafe sets into the housing so it leaves less surface area for little hands to reach up and get burned. It has a timer for delayed brewing, and you can make strong or regular coffee. My husband is a fan of both. The coffee does not come out so hot that it will burn you but it is also not too cool.The recommended number of scoops of coffee per cup of water is not to his personal taste, but that is absolutely a matter of each individual's personal preference.We're VERY happy with the product."
SeaGoddess3240,5.0,"February 12, 2015","I had purchased one of those Hamilton Beach two way brewers last year (during a major sale) because I was dying for a Keurig but could not afford to buy one. Well, sadly, that Hamilton Beach made every cup of coffee taste like plastic (inside the water tank was made of smelly plastic!), so back it went. Since I drink coffee rather infrequently, I decided to try a standard old pot coffee maker and gave this one a try. This was on sale for only $19, and with the Mr. Coffee name, it was a no-brainer. I'm so glad I took the chance and didn't opt for a costlier model!This little coffee maker works great for the price. The coffee tastes great, is nice and hot, and the machine is easy to use. I like the fact I can program the coffee to be brewing in the morning when I wake up. It's nice to get out of the shower with a hot pot of coffee waiting for you.This is an incredible value for the money and highly recommend it."
Kristine Rodgers,1.0,"January 9, 2016","This pot worked great for 4 months then broke. We only used purified water in it to help preserve the mechanism since hard water can do a number on coffee pots, but even the cheap ones have lasted us years not months. I would have returned it but I was told it had to be within one month so this is my only recourse. I am very disappointed in this pot and will try another brand next time. There are too many available to take a chance."
Andrew,2.0,"August 18, 2015","The coffee this machine makes is decent enough, I have no complaints there.My issue with this coffee maker is how painfully slow it is. That said, there are some people this would work just fine for.I like to have people over regularly, and in a single sitting we can go through 4-6 pots of coffee, which is when the slowness of the coffee maker is really noticeable. Everybody is waiting for it to finish, all the time. This is the reason for the 2 star review.If you're the type who only has coffee once a day, first thing in the morning, and want it ready when you wake up, then this coffee maker would be perfect for you. You can set the auto start time, and it always functioned as it should, and who cares how long coffee takes to make when you're not awake yet.Overall, not a terrible coffee maker, but was far too slow for my liking, taking upwards of 12-15 minutes to brew a single pot of coffee."
Roadking,2.0,"January 15, 2014","Was hoping to get a decent cup of coffee from this machine but was disappointed. Major problem is that the water is not heated sufficiently when the coffee is brewed to deliver a hot cup of coffee when the brewing process stops. As cold tap water temperatures are somewhat cooler out of the tap in the winter I tried slightly preheating the water before placing it in the coffeemaker...no major improvement. Temperature of coffee in pot immediately after being brewed about 145 degrees.What's interesting is that the coffee did indeed get hotter after sitting on the heating element than it was after it initially brewed. Unfortunately, we like to drink coffee immediately after it has been brewed not 30 minutes or an hour later. Our old Braun coffee pot delivered much hotter coffee.A few minor points include the area where you pour water into the coffeemaker being a little smaller than expected,and the need to move the brew water delivery arm back and forth.This coffee maker was bought as one of a few small things that we put under our Christmas tree to give ourselves so the 30 day return period to Amazon has past otherwise it would go back."
Paul,5.0,"January 13, 2012","After reading the top rating from a nationally-recognized consumer's magazine, my wife and I did some checking around and really liked the looks of this Mr. Coffee maker. My wife really likes a piping hot cup of coffee and always had to put her cup in the microwave right away with all of our previous makers. When she read that this one really produced some of the hottest coffee, she was pretty much already sold, and since the machine also looked really nice, we decided to get one for ourselves for Christmas.It fulfilled all of the glowing remarks that we had read - but, unfortunately, it also lived up to the often complaint of really messy pouring anything from the decanter (either water or coffee). Sometimes it pours very nicely, but then it will dribble - or even pour - the liquid all around the pot or the cup. I would think that, after all the years of making coffee decanters, that having the liquid pour out neatly would be a piece of cake. But not with this coffee maker. But, we'll keep trying to ""get the hang of pouring"" because it's a very nice coffee maker in every other aspect - we really like the different colored lights, too - it really looks great in the kitchen!"
Rick,3.0,"September 26, 2016","In 2015 I purchased this unit through Amazon as a replacement of a previous (similar model) Mr. Coffee unit. Basically, appears to be just cosmetically different. I replaced the prior unit because it began leaking water through the vents in the bottom of the base.  About a month ago, this new unit has begun to leak just the same.  The water is clear and the longer the unit sits with water in the reservoir the more water is on the counter top so I surmise it is an internal reservoir leak.  I only use the unit 4 or 5 times a week so there has not been a huge usage. I like the quality of the coffee and the features but a coffee maker should last longer than this.  I am now looking for another brand to replace it.  Buyer beware."
Flotsamfred,2.0,"July 31, 2013","I cannot use the strong brew setting with the optional thermal pot.  I have called tech support and they have sent me 4 coffee makers and they all do the same thing.  Put in water and coffee, insert the thermal pot made for this unit and press the strong brew button.  The strong brew lights up, the coffee starts to brew and then the coffeemaker starts to beep as if it is at the end of the brew cycle and then promptly shuts down completely. No coffee!!  Even with the glass pot if you try to use the strong brew setting the coffeemaker beeps, the strong brew indicator shuts off but at least it makes a fair pot of coffee.  No one at Mr. Coffee ( Jarden)knows what to do.  So do not expect to brew with the thermal pot if you like strong coffee.  Amazon was good and at first sent me a replacement but that did the same thing so I called Jarden and then they started sending me coffeemakers.  Now I make the coffee in the glass pot and transfer it to the thermal.  Should have stuck with Cuisinart."
IrishEid09,4.0,"November 27, 2013","The first pot I made ended up in a clock display that had so much condensation in it that I couldnt see it. I used the pre-set brew and that mode seemed to work fine. The big problem came when after the 4th pot, the machine stopped working. No buttons worked and it would not brew a cup. I asked for a replacement so I will try and comment after I use the replacement. Not impressed at all so far!Edit:So I have had my replacement coffee maker for about a week now and I have to add a few things. First of all, the Amazon return policy is fantastic. As soon as I submitted my claim, the new product was shipped to my house.As far as the coffee maker goes, this time there was no condensation on the display, the unit smelled better after brewing, and I have had zero problems thus far. It must have been something in production that made the previous coffee maker function poorly. If the coffee maker keeps working as it does now, I will be very happy with the product."
Edna Ritz,4.0,"December 20, 2012","This coffee machine works fine. Had it for a few weeks already. I use whole beans and grind in a separate grinder.Comments-PRO-+ Cheap price+ Coffee comes out very good+ Not overly bulky+ Pot does not dribble when pouring like some designs+ Water fill is fine, and I am not seeing coffee grinds overflow or spill where it does not belongCON-water filter assembly sits on top of the coffee in the filter. It has to be placed each run. Filter holder tends to open when being handled and is a slightly clumsy step to set up again.Take note-Machine has only 2 hour keep warm. I need the coffee early, while rest of house drinks it +3 hrs later. One trick is to turn on again, and it will 'finish' due to no water and start the 2 hours over. They sell a thermal carafe too.-Does not ship with the coffee filters. Neither metal nor sample of paper ones.

Signs of that happening would mean that you'll get less coffee than you would expect."

I purchased it & didn't actually use it for a week or two then used it for a couple days and was unhappy. Washed it many times, tried it again, no luck. Thought perhaps it was the filters or basket so put it away, continued to use my old one thru the holidays then finally ordered a ""permanent"" basket thinking that would help... NOPE. Got the new basket, bad taste continued so cleaned it again. I tried everything - Hot water, vinegar, coffee pot cleaner, etc. No luck. By then it was too late to return (my fault) so I'm out of luck. Luckily, I didn't pay a whole lot but read other reviews on this machine - Seems to be folks either love it or hate. Many that hate it list the taste as the reason... Do your research."
Raquel,1.0,"June 29, 2015","Decent looking design and easier to program than our old one, but there are a few minor issues and one MAJOR issue.  The major issue is that there is an auto sensor on this model that was broke from day 1 that switches to ""Thermal"" or ""Glass"", It is stuck in the Thermal Mode.  In the Thermal mode, it switches the hot plate off and unless you have a Metal Thermal Carafe you can't get hot coffee after the first cup.  We do NOT own a metal Carafe, so it was quite frustrating...Luckily, I found a YouTube video (that said this model is notorious for this device failing) for advice and I opened up the bottom of the machine and removed the Thermal sensor (wasn't too tough), and now the problem is solved, but I'm sure I voided my warranty.Minor issues - I don't care for the flat bottom filter either, seems like we use more coffee, and I don't really care for the organization of the components in the  tray area.  They don't easily fit into each other and you have to move the water tube spout over each time you access the coffee tray and the water filter that sits on top gets dirty each time you brew coffee.  Overall, I wish I would have spent a bit more and bought something a little better, the bargain buys are usually for a reason..."
C. Brick,5.0,"December 30, 2013","At two pots of coffee every day, our coffeemakers don't last us very long.  We've spent as much as $400 for a coffeemaker in the past, and there have always been issues:  Pots that dribble when you pour, leaky drip delays, swivel grounds cups that don't stay where they're supposed to stay, hot plates that get too hot, etc., etc.  This little cheapie is compact, has great features, and makes a fine pot of coffee every time.  The only drawback is the appearance of the front of the unit.  I don't know why I expected an appliance this inexpensive to have a stainless-steel appearance, and, of course, this doesn't.  The front is a silver plastic material which looks pretty cheap.  That isn't enough to make me downgrade the unit, but others might disagree.  For the money, this is a winner."
Meg,2.0,"April 11, 2015","Update -- 18 months later, 6 months out of warranty, the tubing is leaking internally.  Two cups of water are lost each time we brew.  I wasn't expecting this to last forever but not even two years?  BooooWe bought into the Keurig craze but after the most recent machine went kaput, I couldn't see spending $100 on another, plus $0.70 on a cup of coffee going forward, especially given the waste that Keurig cups produce.  We went looking for a simple but good coffee maker to replace it and I couldn't be happier.  It's programmable, makes great coffee, well constructed (no leaks or splashes when pouring or dripping), simple to operate, great looking on the counter with the black and ""chrome"", and a great price.That smell of coffee brewing in the morning is sooooooooooooo goooooooooooooood."
Judy,1.0,"April 11, 2016","I gave this 1 star because I couldn't find anything to denote dissatisfaction.  After cleaning prior to first time use, I made a pot of coffee.  However, none of the lights came on, the clock did not show the time and I could not turn it off using the switch.  I had to unplug it.  Now if I plug it in, it starts trying to brew another cup of coffee.  I purchased this in Dec. to use if my other pot went out so I cannot return it.  I'm very aggravated now!Since writing this review, I contacted Mr. Coffee at their toll free number and they are sending a replacement of higher value.  They were very courteous and are trying to make this right."
Amazon Customer,4.0,"December 22, 2015","Had really good luck with a previous Mr. Coffee so decided to go with this one, because hey, I had the Mr. Coffee carafe's already!  The unit was fine for a while but then died around eight months.  I think the heating element blew or something.  I contacted Jarden to see if they might stand by their product and it appears they do!  They apologized and sent me a new one no questions asked.  So I do think a coffee maker should last more than 8 months so no five-star rating but on the other hand, Jarden stands by their products so if you do happen to get one that has some production issue that affects its longevity, you can rest assured that you have a solid company behind the product.  And having that great customer service behind something at this price point is very reassuring."
K. Creek,4.0,"May 22, 2016",It makes coffee so it does what we want.Pros: Makes 12 cups  Auto start feature  Different brew strengths (regular and strong)Cons: Placement of the water guide. Most sink sprayers are on the right hand side of the sink. The water guide is on the right side of the machine. I wish it was on the left side so it would be easier to see how much water I was putting into the coffee maker. Using the spray is much easier than filling the decanter and dumping it in.  You can't change the timer on how long the coffee maker is on. After 2 hours it turns off.  The print under the buttons rub off. I have never had a coffee maker where the print rubs off as quickly as this one has.
A reader,3.0,"February 23, 2014","The coffee this makes is fine. Bad coffee is rarely the fault of a machine, anyway, it is almost always human error. Human error is all over the gaffe-fest of this design. There are several pretty LEDs on the control panel. Too bad one could not be added to back light the clock. The clock is set into a deep recess so it is unreadable unless you are on the same level. Be prepared to get on your hands and knees to read or program.  The glass carafe does not ""clicK"" well onto the warmer so unless you position it exactly it runs over. When the maker starts, it emits three LOUD beeps, which may wake you up if, like me, you have it set to come on ten minutes before your usual arising time. The optional thermal carafe does work very well though. Mr. Coffee needs to give the 70s their technology back and make just a few inexpensive changes to make this worth buying. Since this was only about $30, when this breaks, I will toss it without a second thought"
MM,4.0,"June 13, 2014","I bought this coffee pot to replace a caspresso that I was really disappointed in. I've had it for about a month now. It makes really good coffee, at a good temperature. I like the strong/normal brew options.Pros: easy to set, makes good coffee, looks good on my counter, if I break the carafe it's easy to just get a new one at a big box storeCons: big footprint, hard to clean the tank (problem with all coffee pots without a removable tank)Something I did not realize before purchase is that if you prefer to use a thermal carafe, you can get a mr. coffee brand one, and this coffee maker will detect that you're using a thermal carafe and will turn the heat plate off. I haven't used that, but if you're a person who will drink a pot of coffee over a long period of time, I'd recommend doing that to avoid that coffee burn taste, because the hot plate, is, indeed, quite hot."
Rick,2.0,"August 1, 2013","I was replacing the exact same model Mr Coffee coffee maker that I had used without issue for years. When brewing coffee with the new unit, I selected the ""Strong"" brew button as I had done with the previous unit countless times. After only 15 seconds, the ""Strong"" brew feature turned itself off and the end of brew alarm sounded. The unit kept brewing until finished and the 2-hour shut off and alarm did work. However, one of the reasons I choose this model was for the ""Strong"" brew feature. I returned the unit and quickly received a replacement. The second unit had the exact same problem. Both times I confirmed operation with Mr Coffee customer service. I have been sent a different model directly from Mr Coffee. Unfortunately, I have a metal thermal carafe, purchased specifically for the original model that I can no longer use. This once great (5-star) coffee maker has apparently lost quality control entirely in its current production. Sad."
Jean H,3.0,"February 20, 2015","I am really having a problem understanding all the negative reviews.  This is a great coffee maker.  We have had the machine for about 2 weeks now and we love it.  Had absolutely NO plastic smell upon opening or after brewing. Everything works exactly as advertised.  Easy to fill, water dispersed evenly over the coffee grounds, delayed brew works great, coffee stays very hot for 2 hours, shuts off automatically, able to pour a cup during brewing with no overflow or dripping, easy pour carafe with no dripping.  We have not experienced any of the problems that others have listed.  Nice design and great price on Amazon (cheaper than Wal-Mart) and free shipping with Amazon.  Overall, a wonderful inexpensive coffee maker.Update: unfortunately, this lasted for only two years before the water started leaking all over the counter.  Turns out, the water tube inside the machine cracked."
DrBB,4.0,"January 18, 2014","I bought the BVMC-SJX33GT based on its longevity, popularity, and ratings. It took about a week to realize I needed to use a bit more coffee per mug (3.5 vs. 3 measures with my old coffeemaker) to get the same full flavor from my coffee; however, since I adapted the amount of coffee I use and gotten used to the control settings, I have been pleased with the general ease of making coffee every day. I do have two minor complaints. First, I need to turn the coffeemaker 90 degrees to fill it with water. I'm not sure why Mr. Coffee designed the machine to require this. Second, while the initial brewing temperature is excellent, the hot plate actually seems to keep the coffee too hot. If the carafe has less than half a cup remaining immediately after brewing, much of it will evaporate by the end of the two-hour ""warm"" cycle. For those who like to make coffee to be savored later in the day, this model may not be the best choice."
caboshores,5.0,"January 17, 2013","My wife and I enjoy morning coffee.  When our previous maker died, we read the reviews on several replacements and decided on this Mr. Coffee product.  Great choice.  Before using we washed the plastic components with dishsoap, then ran two pots of water thru (no coffee) to help eliminate what other reviewers said was a plastic taste.  We experienced no plastic taste.  Directions are easy to understand, no leaks, no messes that others claim was a problem.  We've operated the maker on both the normal-brew and heavy-brew settings, and there is a taste difference.  Since we all have our own taste, you be the judge.  (and we found we use a little less dry coffee between the two settings)  The only issue (at first) is the clock is not back-lit.  When we first set the clock and timer, they were tough to see.  Once set though, we haven't had to reset them and quite frankly we don't need another clock in our kitchen anyway since there's the oven clock and the microwave clock and our stupid smartphones have clocks and who cares what time it is anyway.  Just enjoy your morning coffee."
5stardez,5.0,"May 12, 2016",If you keep this clean it keeps going. It is a great inexpensive product that works time after time. If you do not keep it cleaned well or have hard water that will cause build up it slows the brew process down and the timer will go off saying the coffee is brewrd when there is still half a pot left to brew. But if you clean it it goes  right back to working perfect. Best part is the pot switched from glass pot to thermal and had all the measurements for both. Love that it has the set up to brew automatically and starts precisely.
Reader,5.0,"November 14, 2020","After 6+ yrs tho, it started leaking from the clear tubing inside.  Replaced tubing and now it's boiling the water non-stop.  Not a big deal so I would just order a new one since I also have the thermal carafe, BUT NOW IT'S $120!  What ever happened?"
TOTR,1.0,"January 23, 2016","(After contacting Amazon by phone they have agreed to a refund and to place a hold on selling this item and review all the feedback customers have been giving on the defective nature of this item.

Deanna Devine,5.0,"July 5, 2016",We have been looking for about a month now trying to find a new coffee pot. We've decided to try this one and so far so good. I like how it has the different strengths of brewing because I like the coffee a little bit stronger sometimes. The design looks good sitting on our counter and it is very easy to use. It also has a filter that sits above the coffee and filters the water before it goes into the grinds. We already use filtered water in our coffee so we don't necessarily use the filter all the time but it's nice to have when we have to use tap water. My favorite feature is that the coffee pot beeps when it is done brewing. My last one didn't do that so it's nice to actually know when my coffee is ready to start drinking. We don't use the delayed brew feature to start in the morning by itself so not too sure how that works.
Theboardrider,4.0,"November 5, 2015","This was a great purchase, as it's easy to use, almost like a computer with ""plug and play,"" capability. The controls are so intuitive and simple, I don't believe I opened the directions for anything other than to register the warranty.It makes coffee consistently, quietly, cleanly and simply.  It's got the onboard cleaning setting which I have used once, and actually did notice a difference afterward.  You could buy this machine for any younger generation person, but also if the grandparents are in the market for a new coffeemaker and you'd like to upgrade them but are concerned about it being too complicated...I'd say this is the one that would meet their needs and have little learning curve."
E. Hanes,1.0,"August 21, 2016","I really enjoyed using this coffee maker...while it lasted.  I purchased it less than two years ago, and today when I tried to brew coffee, it was dead. Considering I only used it once a day and then shut it off, it seems like it should have lasted a lot longer than it did. It's not like we left it on all day or anything. I can't take points off for the quality of the brew, because it was very good. But it's pretty harsh to have to replace this so quickly. And for those who might we wondering: we did not experience a power surge or anything that would have damaged the unit. It seems to have just expired of natural causes."
Holly,1.0,"November 5, 2015","We've always loved Mr. Coffee products and this is no exception.  We really like the ""strong brew"" feature, but don't use most of the other options.  Even though some reviews stated a weird taste to the coffee, we haven't noticed anything like that.  Great value!****UPDATE:  After owning this coffee maker for a few weeks, it definitely gave us the plastic flavor.  Horrible and completely undrinkable!  We've always been fans of MC, but now I wonder if our health has been affected by leaching chemicals.  We used the ""strong brew"" feature almost exclusively, so clearly the higher heat or whatever is used to make the brew stronger, kicks in the plastic flavor.  We've since switched to an all-metal percolator."
J. Brydges,5.0,"October 6, 2014","I love this Coffemaker, it works just as well as some of those more pricey machines out there. It also is very pretty and looks really impressive on my counter. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened it, I was expecting a little less pizzazz but once I got it out - Wow! This model has very nice features like a water filter over the coffee basket. It is also very easy to fill with water. Very easy to set up and it brews a very nice pot of coffee. I grind my own beans using the Mr. Coffee BVMC-BMH23 Automatic Burr Mill Grinder and use Mr. Coffee basket coffee filters and I believe I get a pot of coffee that could match most barista's pot of coffee. I have served coffee from this machine to family and friends and they all agree it make one good cup of joe! Highly recommend it with no reservations"
kpc,1.0,"May 21, 2013","I liked the coffeemaker and it made great coffee for 3 months.  Then the delay brew quit working.  The coffeemaker still works it you start it manually, but I purchased it for the convenience of waking to hot, brewed coffee ready to go.Update 7/10/13 -- I called for a replacement coffeemaker (coffeemaker has a 1 yr. warranty - only 5 months old) and it was promptly delivered by the manufacturer without any hassle.  Unfortunately, the new coffeepot quit working after one brew.  When I got up, the clock had lost 4 hours. I reset the clock and skipped the delay brew to start the coffee. It just sat there. The lights were on, but no brewing, no heating.  I am calling again today to try to get replacement #2, but I if this doesn't work, I am done with this model for good. We have use Mr. Coffee for 20 years without issue, but clearly this one is a lemon."
Suzy,3.0,"November 17, 2015","My husband loves coffee, and we really liked this machine while it worked. We only have had it since July and out of nowhere the water started coming right out through the bottom. We did nothing different with this machine, and it just crapped out on us. We were very disappointed. Besides that when the machine did work it worked great. The option to brew your coffee strong or regular strength is pretty cool too, and even though it has a lot of buttons it was very easy to use. I don't think we will be buying another Mr. Coffee brand machine as I have read many reviews even on other models where the machine started leaking everywhere."
JA Kling,5.0,"February 23, 2015","Great coffee maker. Purchased this after reading Consumer Reports ratings. Very easy to use. Ditched the filter that everyone was complaining about being so expensive to replace as we use filtered water anyway. Easy to set up the system to brew automatically in the morning. I like the strong brew feature. Coffee is just as hot as other coffee makers we have had. It does turn off after 2 hours and isn't adjustable. If I hear it beep and I want it on longer, I just hit the bre button and it will come on again for another two hours. Very happy it turns off by itself or I would have burned coffee."
Tony Taylor,5.0,"December 20, 2013","Coworkers were making a mess, and burning coffee when I wasn't there.  This one fixed that problem with a 2 hour automatic shutoff.  It also has a timer that shows how long it has been on.  Useful when you aren't the first one in the office.  The delay brew is easy to set, and the clock keeps good enough time.  I haven't noticed a drift in the last 2 months.  The carafe doesn't spill when you pour, and it beeps when the timer shuts it down so you can get what's left and not miss it while it is still hot.The filter is a little gimmicky feeling to me, and sort of a hassle to use.  It just sits on top of the basket and you have to take it off to fill with grounds, and put it back on to brew.  Personally I think a filter should be before the water heater so it doesn't foul up with minerals and overheat or slow down the brew process.  I'd deduct a half star if I could for that.  I didn't take a whole one because I just don't bother using it."
Samantha,4.0,"June 15, 2016",I have bought 3 of these same coffee makers. 2 of the 3 have been great so far but one crapped out after only 3 months... which is pretty sad. I originally bought 2 for Christmas presents for my mom and my mother-in-law. One of them stopped working correctly after 3 months and I ended up buying another to replace it. There is some kind of manufacturer's warranty on this product but I thought it was easier to just buy a new one rather than going through all the headache of getting it replaced. the new one has been going strong for 3 months now and one of the first that I bought it still going strong now and was bought/used starting in December.
CK Twain,1.0,"April 19, 2014","Mine does not have an issue with the plastic odor, however it does take 15 minutes to brew a pot..  seriously just a pitiful trickle. The comments about the water filter being needed to actually soak all the grounds are absolutely correct as well. The strong brew feature does not work. It's on just long enough to walk away, then in shuts the darn thing off. The display does not light up... what the heck, idiots! This thing financially is not a big loss, but after they sucker you into the carafe and gold filter on top of what you consider your time to be worth, It's an absolute unnecessary waste!Realistically... even if it didn't have all these issues, it's still not a 5 star item. It's basic features and cheap craftsmanship assure that all those hundreds of people who gave this POS 5 stars are over zealous to say the least!!"
Wm Sutro,1.0,"May 1, 2016","What a dissapointment !  It's way too tall..13""  Sunbeam makes them..enough said?  You can't see the digital clock as it's not lighted nor angled upwards.  The carafe narrows at the top, so for a man it's not easy to wash and hand dry.  The water reservoir is very difficult to pour, because it is so crowded with the equally poorly designed filter tray which can't sit flat on a counter.  If you get a cup before it's finished, there is considerable drip to the burner.  The coffee is good from this horrible design, but choose another company.  This, and likely all Mr. Coffees are poorly designed Sunbeam offerings.  I wouldn't give this to anyone.  Sad but all true."
DStuart,2.0,"September 15, 2015","So very disappointed with this coffee maker. I have to sit and watch this thing brew; otherwise, the water and coffee grounds overflow into the water reservoir and then all over the counter...I use this coffeemaker at work, and I do not have the time nor the facilities to clean up huge quantities of wet coffee grounds and coffee from the coffeemaker and counter.  Don't waste your money on this machine.  The water does not filter through fast enough to keep up with the hot water coming into the coffee grinds.  Very aggravating machine. Is going to be replaced."
C. Weisberger,5.0,"March 9, 2015","We have had experience over the years with many coffee makers of all ilks. Most recently we've been grinding our beans and using an upscale Braun drip machine or French presses. When the Braun recently gave up the ghost I started looking for a good buy in a similar machine. I had bought a Mr. Coffee for work some years back and it lasted many years trouble free. I saw this one for a very good price on Amazon and decided to try it. It has been great. No difference from the Braun and we've actually started to use pre ground and paper filters and the flavor especially with medium roast has been excellent. We are very happy with this machine at this point and if it lasts for a good few years, we will consider it one of our better coffee machine investments."
Proud Father,5.0,"January 13, 2014","Like others, I became interested in this machine after Consumer Reports said it made superior coffee.  Then I went onto Amazon and read the reviews.  Seemed like half loved it and half hated it.  Big complaints included a strong ""plasticky"" smell and an odd taste that stuck around after multiple brews.  That actually kept me from buying it, but when the price dropped to next-to-nothing over the holidays, I decided to take the plunge.We should have bought this thing years ago.  It makes great coffee, albeit slightly on the strong side of the spectrum.  We actually use less coffee than we needed with our prior machine to get the taste just right.  The trick is that this machine preheats the water more than others, extracting as much coffee goodness from the grounds as possible.We haven't had any issues with odd smells or tastes.  It just makes great coffee which is what everyone wants, right?  The only negative is that the preheating creates a lot of steamy condensation inside the machine, so when you open it after a brew to toss the grounds, condensation droplets from the lid can make a mess on your countertop.  I should also note that the process of priming the water filter before use takes a lot of water.  I'm not 100% sure if the water filter actually enhances the taste, but we've been using it."
Jess S,4.0,"December 17, 2014","My only real complaint with this coffeemaker is that it is not very leftie-friendly.  The top cover of the coffeemaker flips open to the left, like a notebook.  So to fill the tank, you have to either come at it from a weird angle (I might try rotating the machine 90°), or pour the water in with your right hand.  While it's certainly doable, it's a bit awkward and unwieldy for me while I'm getting used to it.  Also, the water filter is kind of janky (technical term) and seems somewhat unnecessary unless you have a horrible water supply, but it's nice to have as an option.  Aside from that, it seems like a pretty solid machine so far, especially as ""standard"" drip coffeemakers go.  I like that I can swap out the glass carafe for a thermal one (not included but available at a decent price) if I want to."
Sagewick,3.0,"August 7, 2016","There's not much to expect when it comes to a coffee maker. All it has to do is make up to twelve cups of coffee right? Well not quite.This model of the Mr.Coffee is programmable, features two different settings for how strong the brew is, as well as a standard 12-cup coffee pot --After several months of near-everyday use I have to say that this model is a worthy purchase for those not looking to spend much money, But want to make sure there's enough coffee in the house for everyone. I'll cover what you need to know in two categories;PROS: Programmable -- Can set up your pot of coffee for when you wake up next morning.  Burner -- Features a burner beneath that keeps the coffee warm (without cooking it) for up to two hours before automatically shutting off.  Fast Brew Time -- Your pot of coffee will be hot and ready within 5 - 10 minutes depending on how much coffee is being brewed.CONS: Dual - Brew Settings -- Only the ""Regular"" setting seems to work properly, while ""Strong"" attempts to brew a stronger batch of coffee by brewing it hotter. Instead the unit will just burn off most of the water leaving a small puddle of sooty coffee in your pot. Yuck  Water Loss -- Despite using the ""Regular"" brew setting, this coffee pot seems to completely evaporate 1 - 2 cups of water with every batch you make. Effectively contradicting the ""12-cup"" in the product title."
D John,4.0,"October 5, 2014","Easy to load and brew.  The water level is clear and I can load it up without having to fetch my reading glasses.  The filters are right up front so it's easy to change them (and to remember that they should be changed occasionally.  Makes a pretty good cup of coffee although I find myself using the ""strong"" setting most of the time.  I find the flat-bottom gold filter a bit harder to clean than it's cone-shaped cousin, but that's just a nit.My only complaint is that they made a 12-cup device that can only brew 8 cups if you use the thermal carafe.  Why??  Most mornings I make coffee with the glass carafe, pour my first cup (mug), then empty the glass carafe into the (pre heated) thermal carafe.  This means more stuff to clean!"
bdowden,3.0,"February 8, 2016","Ordered & received this product less than 3 weeks ago and it already crapped out. The on/off button is the only one that works now. It will turn on, but won't brew.No I'm not an idiot. Worked great for 2 weeks. Really enjoyed having fresh coffee waiting for me when I woke up in the morning. Not sure what happened, but it refuses to work now. Have tried all of the troubleshooting items listed in the device manual. Will be returning. Pain in the rear.UPDATE: They sent me a replacement under the warranty when it crapped out the first time. 1 year and 4 months later (JUST outside of the warranty period) & the machine has done exactly the same thing again. Waking up on a Monday morning to a non-working coffee maker is just not okay!!! We'll definitely be replacing with something different this time. That being said, if you're just looking for a cheaper coffee maker that will only last around a year at a time; then this one's for you!"
Amazon Customer,1.0,"May 23, 2014","I bought this because it got great reviews.  While the coffee it makes doesn't taste bad, it isn't hot enough for my taste, plus if you don't get the coffee basket and filter in JUST RIGHT, coffee goes all over the place, making a huge mess.  And try figuring out how to get it in right....it's nearly impossible.  I also bought it for the PAUSE feature so I can get my first cup immediately.  Pause?  It doesn't pause?  Coffee goes all over the place.  It doesn't stop making coffee when you take the carafe out.  I'm seriously disappointed in this coffee maker and I'm sorry I'm stuck with it.  Spend more money and get a better unit."
Amara,3.0,"September 17, 2015","I give it a 3 star because it is easy to use and it is very nice looking.  But the coffee basket has an unbelievable bad, plastic taste.  We have not been able to rid this bad taste.  It is embarrassing as I bought this pot for my sister and husband whose house was destroyed by the Butte fire in Calaveras County fire in California and are staying with me.  My brother-in-law drinks a lot of coffee which makes it expensive to use my Keurig.  I can not return it as my brother-in-law tore the box up and placed in recycle, and i do not have the money to replace it.  They will have to wait until home insurance kicks in."
Elizabeth C. Hardeman,3.0,"April 7, 2016","Coffee is my only vise these days. I enjoyed the programmable function. For some reason the coffee would just never seem to get hot enough for my liking. Seems I would always have to put it in my microwave. Within the 1st month I had accidently tapped it against the side of the sink while washing. It oh course cracked making me have to order another coffee pot. Within the next month the machine just stopped working completely. I've had Mr. Coffee machines in the past that worked fine. I'm still old school, I like my coffee percolated."
S. Park,5.0,"January 28, 2014","Of all the coffee makers we've used over the years, this coffee maker makes the best coffee and it costs only a fraction of the other more expensive ones.  I like the beep when the brew cycle is finished and the coffe temperature is just perfect.  The only complaint I had was that the carafe always drips, no matter how you try to avoid it. Eventually, those drips accumulated at the base and the heating plate got rusty and bumpy. That's why I decided to get a new replacement and it didn't disappoint!  The plastic lid on the carafe has a wider opening and so far, I haven't noticed any drips anywhere.  They also eliminated the bottom basket for the filter, but the new design works just as well. I'm really happy with this coffee maker!"
James,4.0,"August 25, 2013","The other morning when I woke up, I decided to make a pot of coffee.  My old coffee pot developed the planned obsolesce problem (you know that coffee pots have a known time-to-fail, right?).  Picked up this one to match the brushed stainless in my kitchen.  Well, silly me, Chrome and Stainless look nothing alike.Haven't made use of any of the ""advanced"" features like timer or filling a personal mug.  I do like that the water reservoir has very clear water-level markers.  I fill mine from a pitcher and this makes it super easy.It comes with a filter for the water, not really sure how effective it is.Like most coffee pots, the brew-pausing will still cause one or two drops to drip onto the warmer plate.  Seems like that should be solved by now."
Don M.,5.0,"December 10, 2014","Works well. Coffee taste is not quite as good as from our French Press, but close. We bought both paper filters and the lifetime metal mesh filter. The paper filters are easier to use and less messy. Just slip a plastic bag over the paper filter and plastic housing, invert while holding on to the bag and plastic housing and the old coffee grounds and paper filter drop to the bottom of the plastic bag. This is a lot easier than washing old grounds out of the permanent metal filter. We noticed no difference in coffee taste between using the paper filters or the metal filter. This unit keeps the coffee hot for a couple of hours after brewing, which meets our needs for a leisurely breakfast and a couple of refills......."
Drborig,3.0,"May 14, 2014",I bought this to replace our Mr. Coffee that stopped working due to the hard water we have.  We have to replace our coffee maker just about every other year even though we regularly clean it and filter our water.  This coffee maker is attractive to look at but I didn't notice that it didn't have the permanent filter on it.  We like the permanent filters rather than having to keep paper filters in it.  We then found the permanent filter from our old Mr Coffee and use it in this coffee maker without a problem.  The main issue with this maker is the coffee doesn't taste as good as any of our previous Mr. Coffee machines.  I have to make the coffee stronger to improve the taste.  We'll continue to use this until it dies but I won't buy this model again.
C.C.,4.0,"November 23, 2014","No issues so far.  Mine came great and fully functional.  I bought this on behalf of our staff and office and right when it came out of the box I did 6 water passes to clear out the plastic smell most reviewers complained about.  The smell was not overpowering the first few times but it was present.  After the 6th time it was faint.  We brewed 8 cups of coffee afterwards and our coffee tasted great.  No plastic smell or taste whatsoever.  Which says a lot cause, our office drinks the higher end coffee (the $10-$18 small bag kind).  We are satisfied.  Though there doesn't seem to be a taste difference in slow brew or regular brew.  Nonetheless, a decent coffee maker what we need it for."
Kindle Customer,1.0,"March 20, 2014",I read the reviews on here before buying this coffee maker.  I also looked at the ratings on Consumer Reports to find that it was a top rated coffee maker.  I had a lot of faith that the Consumer Reports ratings would show the bad reviews about this coffee maker to be wrong - and I was wrong.I've adjusted the grind of the beans.  I've adjusted the quantity.  I've switched the roast of the beans.  I've tried the Strong Brew option.  It just doesn't make good coffee.The coffee is weak.  The basket water dispenser sort of drips water into the center of the grind basket rather than showering the basket as a whole.  The hot plate is too hot.  It burns the coffee after the first hour on the warming plate.I wish this was a good coffee maker but it just isn't making the grade.
Dakota Bob,4.0,"January 21, 2015","Brews good coffee.  Controls are slightly un-intuitive (e.g. push the brew button twice to engage the delay brew).  However, I like that it can use glass or thermal carafes, and the coffee is a decent temperature.The lid to access the brew basket and water fill area is a little too tall when open to fit under my upper cabinets, so I have to pull it forward on the counter to make coffee.  I know, kind of a 1st world problem...  Also, the status lights are very bright (actually too bright), but since I don't sleep in the kitchen on a regular basis, I don't care too much.Apart from a few nits, a very serviceable coffee maker, and quite a bargain.  Satisfied customer."
PHD76,1.0,"November 4, 2014","Admittedly I only used this product once. But here's what happened... Barely half of the grounds in the basket even got wet, and the resulting coffee was really weak. The water spout was in the correct position (as far as I could tell). Maybe this particular machine was defective. I have no idea. But this was a very discouraging experience. To me it looks like a design flaw. The water drips from a narrow spout. I guess the assumption is that eventually the water will spread throughout the basket but this did not happen for me. I bought this product based in part on the good review it got in Consumer Reports. But I learned once again that you get what you pay for."
Notvested,5.0,"January 25, 2015","Prior to use, I ran a solution of vinegar and water (2/3 water and 1/3 vinegar) through the coffee cycle and had ZERO plastic taste in the system. I read the reviews and heard complaints so I'm passing along to others to save you from plastic tastes."
My Opinion,3.0,"May 12, 2013","I have had the BVMC-SJX33GT for approximately two months and it works perfectly. However, I am rating this model only three stars, because of the plastic taste in the brew. For the first week or so, there was a heavy plastic smell coming from the maker while it was brewing. This eventually went away for the most part, but ever now and then the smell returns. In addition, the coffee has a hint of the taste of plastic even though I am using the water filters. Not good, but I am hoping that it will eventually go away.The other negative, which I admit is minor, is that the opening on the carafe is kind of small, which makes it difficult to get my hand inside the carafe to wash it. Not a big deal."
Kindle Customer,1.0,"February 10, 2015","This item was delivered to my home on December 24, 2014.  It is now February 10, and we are sorry to report that Mr. Coffee has died.  We checked all the recommendations in the owner's guide and it still does not work.  On closer examination, the seal under the filter was obviously broken reflecting a looped silver-like wire.  Husband says this allowed steam to go up into the mechanism where the control buttons are. A person told me she had two of these type coffee makers and they both failed because of the steam build up internally.  Called the warrantee service and they said Amazon will replace it.  But Amazon reflects it can't be returned to them after January 31, 2015. Sob, sob."
Eric Black,5.0,"May 21, 2014","I live in a house with 3 other adults, so in the five months since I purchased this machine it's gotten plenty of use (nearly a full pot every day; sometimes two) and has been quite reliable.To my knowledge, we've all been using the strong brew setting, and the coffee tastes fine (as good as you can expect from an inexpensive coffee maker), though I'm curious to test some people's claim that the normal setting will actually brew a stronger cup of coffee -- I'll admit I haven't tried brewing coffee on the normal setting. On days when I don't have to be anywhere early, I usually prefer taking the extra time to prepare a French press, unless one of the others in the house have already brewed a full pot (which is most of the time). Come to think of it, I haven't heard a single complaint from them about the machine, so take that as a thumbs up from 4 different people.The brew timer is a lifesaver for days when I need to wake up exceptionally early and might not have the time or energy to brew coffee in the morning.The only real issues I've had are just related to getting used to the machine. As others have mentioned, the coffee maker will produce a volume of coffee that is less than the amount you put into the reservoir, most likely due to evaporation. To solve this, I just add an extra half to full cup of water, depending on the size of the pot I'm brewing. I think the water filtration disc that goes above the brew basket may likely impact the amount of evaporation that occurs, so I tend to not use it, since I can just put filtered water in the reservoir anyway. (Honestly I think the quality of the local tap water is pretty good, but there are large mineral deposits, so I consider adding filtered water to the reservoir to be more essential than using the water filtration disc, especially as far as machine maintenance goes.)The other issue is also something mentioned by others -- that is, coffee spillage when trying to pour a cup of coffee with the lid down. When your brain hasn't yet met its full potential due to lack of coffee, remembering to lift the lid can be challenging. Even so, I think this is a minor issue.Overall, I've had a good experience with this machine and can recommend it if you're looking for a coffee-maker on a budget."
Kindle Customer,2.0,"July 28, 2016","Gave to my wife last July as a birthday gift.  Yesterday, while she was waiting for six cups of water to brew into coffee, after two cups had dripped into the carafe,  it suddenly stopped brewing.  All the lights are on and it has power.  We followed a You Tube video and removed the bottom, took out the two plastic water tubes and the metal heating tube.  These did not appear to be clogged or dirty, and after putting it back together, still had lights and power, but no action.  Several other reviewers have had very similar experiences with this model.  One year?  Is that the life of a $29 coffee pot these days.  We are just past the end of the one year limited warranty.  My wife got out her much older and much used coffee pot--it still makes coffee, but sometimes leaks.  That is why I got her this one.  Not going to order another one like it."
jetames,5.0,"November 19, 2011","This coffee maker replaced a 15 year old Mr Coffee maker that is still operating perfectly.  We gave the old one to friends.We did all the research.  This maker is rated #1 by Consumer Reports and by my husband and me!  Most certainly, we were concerned about the negative reports here on Amazon.This is a perfect coffee maker that has every feature you could want.  The coffee maker is QUIET, stylish, sleek, has a start timer and a chime to tell you when the coffee is ready.  It shuts itself off in two hours should you forget.We have experienced NONE of the problems reported by other buyers.  No flooding, no plastic smells, nothing but excellent coffee.  And certainly, no one can complain about the price either!I was not a coffee drinker for many years, but now I am thanks to Mr Coffee.Buy it, you'll like it!  Guaranteed!"
iburke,5.0,"February 6, 2015","Best coffee maker for the price. Brews hot, quality coffee (don't forget, the beans have as much an effect on the quality as the brewer). Recommend you spend more money on the beans and save money by buying this coffee maker. Don't be fooled by these $200 machines if all you're doing is putting in pre-ground, Dunkin coffee, you will not get better results.Spent the $200 instead on this quality, but cheap, coffee maker, a nice capresso grinder, and quality beans, and have a better setup than if I just wasted money on a ""high quality"" $200 coffee maker.It's also a huge plus that the machine fits BOTH a thermal Carafe and a glass carafe. A nice touch."
Alicia Dahmes,5.0,"December 20, 2014","I was a little worried when some of the other reviews spoke of a ""plastic"" taste & smell.  I DID notice this at first; then I tried making the coffee without the removable water filter (a small, flat plastic piece that goes over the coffee grounds to filter the water).  Upon removing that, the plastic smell/taste completely went away.  I just use filtered water to make the coffee.  For the price, this is a GREAT coffee maker.  The programmable part is very easy to learn & use and the coffee tastes great.  http://www.consumersearch.com/ recommended this as the best budget coffee maker - that product review website has never led me astray, and they didn't disappoint this time!"
Artsfan,3.0,"July 8, 2014","A bargain and works fine. My review is a comment on the appearance of this machine. On my screen it is not evident in the photo that this is a blindingly shiny ""chrome"" finish.  Compared to machines by Cuisinart and even my recent West Bend, this one has a cluttered and garish design.  The buttons in front look cheap, not to mention that finish.  Not excited to be greeted by this in the morning.  Glad I usually use my French press.  If you are looking for a simple design sitting on your counter, this is not it.  You may not be someone who is personally offended by design, in which case enjoy your coffee.Also you will need to buy a permanent filter (or paper ones) because no coffee filters are included in the box."
Vicki Andrews,1.0,"December 6, 2016","Bought this coffee maker to replace our Cuisinart that wasn't brewing as hot as it used to. Wasn't looking to spend an arm and a leg for a coffee maker so this seemed like a good choice. I was wrong! After a little over a year, woke up to no coffee in the pot. Found out that the coffee maker was not only failing to heat but wasn't even pushing water through. We had no indications it was going to quit on us! I've owned cheap coffee makers and I've owned expensive coffee makers... Never once have I had a coffee maker quit a little over a year after purchasing! Very disappointed and definitely do not recommend."
John,1.0,"December 12, 2014","I hate this coffee maker. I bought this new coffee maker 7 months ago, and the first thing it did was make my coffee taste terrible. Same coffe+new maker= terrible coffee? THIS ONE DOES. I used the the same brand coffee AND I always use filtered water. It took 3 or more months to get decent cup of coffee from this machine. And be EXTRA careful EVERYTIME you make coffee, if this maker isn't 100% correctly assembled you will have coffee all over the floor. Today was the 5th time in 7 months of counting this machine gave my floor my coffee, not my cup. Like a poor employee, today Mr. Coffe will be relieved of service. I owned a Cuisinart that worked deliciously and flawlessly for 15+years. I am really surprised a maker that is named Mr. Coffee, is so hard to get coffee from. I advise purchasing a different coffee maker. There is nothing more I love to wake up to than cleaning 8+ cups of coffee from my countertop and floor first thing in the morning."
Will Barto,4.0,"March 26, 2014","This coffee maker is very easy to use and makes a tasty pot of coffee! The styling is not unattractive and the lights indicating the status of the machine are readily visible from across the room. The clock display is the only unsatisfactory aspect of the machine, as it does not always display the complete digits in the unlighted window, forcing you on occasion to make an educated guess as to the time when setting the delayed brewing function. But the great price and overall reliability of Mr. Coffee (along with Prime two-day shipping!) make this machine a bargain.  Recommended for generic coffee drinkers who need a functional, reliable machine for kitchen or office."
Outdoor Fun,4.0,"November 12, 2014","Decent automatic, wish there was a way to disable the beep when the coffee is done. It's nothing fancy, but for the price it has my coffee ready when I get up. I could do without the chrome front, but it looks decent. If it lasts a few years it will be a five star product. I'm not sure how functional the various settings are, my wife puts the coffee in and programs it as she doesn't like my eye opener coffee that I make. Turns itself off after a while that feature does not appear to be adjustable, also like that you can grab a cup while it's brewing, but with the auto start it's usually ready by the time I drag myself to the kitchen."
alimo,1.0,"March 23, 2016","Worked great for about 6 months, then started working worse and worse. Ultimately it ended up taking 1.5 hours to make a pot of coffee. Tried cleaning with vinegar and other methods with no luck. Don't waste your money. Apparently this is a newer version that does not live up to the high reviews of the previous. I really enjoyed it until it broke down on me :/EDIT: Received another one as a gift, and it lasted approx 5 months. The heating element must have broke in the middle of it running as it only brewed half of the pot, completely stopped, and the coffee was lukewarm. Tried unplugging it, restarting, making a new batch, nothing. It's a goner. Really frustrating to have to buy a new coffee machine every 6 months. I will not buy another Mr Coffee brand machine again."
elvisaintdead,1.0,"May 31, 2016","I bought this coffeemaker in late Nov '15, and here at the end of May '16, the timer on the unit has quit functioning, which is, pretty much, the entire purpose of buying a coffeemaker with a timer.  It was used to make 1 pot a day.It still works on an ""at the moment"" basis, but it takes 10 mins or so to brew a pot.  When you have to be at work early, waiting on coffee will not do.Breaks after less than a year? On one pot a day? What a joke. No more Mr. Coffee brand for this family."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"August 4, 2016","Ratting on Amazon are high, but at MR Coffee they are awful.  I wish the positive ratings here wouldn't have mislead me.I have had this for just shy of 5 months, so this review is based off of actual use and not just first impressions.My initial thoughts were positive and I had so issues to start, but while disappointing for such a highly rated model, they were not deal breakers.Initial Issues- Clock is not back light and is almost impossible to read.- Hard to clean if coffee grounds go anywhere they are not supposed to.- The removable part that holds the filter, needs to be placed back just right.  If not all the coffee builds up inside and causes quite the mess.After a bit over 4 months, I ran into issues with the burner.  It was getting so hot that the coffee in the carafe was starting to ""pop"" as I think it was close to a boiling point.  After that I did not want to use the auto timer or have it on when people were not around.  Shortly after that issue it stopped brewing at all.  Lights and all that go on and it appears like it should work, but nothing happens.After doing a bit more research on this, it seems to be a VERY COMMON problem with this model, which is why it is currently rated only a 1.7 at Mr Coffee."
Peter Suslock,2.0,"December 6, 2013","Based in part on the review by Consumer Reports, I purchased this coffee maker in haste as ours, a Cuisinart is breaking down. For years I had always found Braun to be the best drip coffee makers. However, when Proctor & Gamble bought Braun they were quick to shut down the small appliance division hence bye-bye Braun.Cuisinart suffered a similar fate when Conair bought them out. Manufacturing from Paris was farmed out to China and both the build quality and performance of most all Cuisinart small appliance have suffered.First the immediate problems associate the Mr. Coffee. I find the build quality less than sub par, virtually free of metal and all plastic construction makes for a flimsy product. The construction is cheap and it feels and looks so. No ABS plastic as you would find in higher end machines such as those made by Bunn, Krups, Kitchdaide and others - instead this is the stuff that's sharp and brittle like bottom basement, Dollar Store toys. In addition the carafe is made of such micro thin glass that I fear any un-intentional tap against a counter corner or other mishap will result in a crack or shatter.The filtering system is useless - and here's why.Having kept fish as a hobby for over 40 years I use a great deal of Activated Carbon to remove chlorine, trace metals and  medications. But I use it sparingly and only for short periods of time. I mention this because if you do choose to use the filters be aware that many people suffer acid indigestion, Gastric Reflux and myriad of other problems to even small traces of Carbon.Activated Carbon also turns bad in time and instead of removing unwanted chemicals and gases from your water it does the opposite - it releases it's own set of pollutants which raise the PH of your water, making it quite a bit more acidic.The message here is, if you're going to use the carbon filters I urge you to swap them out every three - four weeks.* The filtering system - The Mr. Coffee filtration system is poorly thought out. It's awkward and difficult to replace and remove. This is hassle you get yourself into when you commit to on going purchases of replacement filters.* Low heat - Regardless if you drink pure Kona and grind the beans yourself or are just as happy with pre-ground Maxwell House most coffee lovers would agree they want their cup of Joe piping hot.In this regard I agree with many of the reviewers here in that even on the highest setting the coffee just isn't hot enough. Nothing worse than having to micro-wave your coffee immediately after brewing. Of course, this albeit a common trait may not be important to you as we all have different tastes.I will give this model accolades as far as it's aesthetic in relationship to it's rock bottom price. Few models in this price category have any integrity of design what so ever. At least the unit itself although plasticy and toy like - has a clean and gleaming face.However, another design I'm not happy with is the attached lid - making for yet another hassle when running through the dishwasher.Perhaps in a college dorm room or as a back this unit might be the ticket as the price is so low. For us it has proved to be of poor design, cheaply made and a poor performer."
Maggie07,3.0,"December 10, 2015","My daughter has one of these and it's lasted several years. After I saw hers I ordered one. It was adequate-- timer worked, coffee was fine, I loved the water filters though they can be a pain to take out when you add the coffee grounds.  However, less than a year after I got it, it began to leak. It must have developed a crack. I am assuming this is an anomaly as my daughter's version has held up fine. I like it enough I'm considering ordering another (it's not that expensive) but I am disappointed it leaked. Until the leak it was working fine and I had no complaints."
Charolette L Stoehr,4.0,"May 23, 2015","This coffee pot works as described and makes a good pot of coffee. I have no odor issues or leaks and have been using it daily for several months. When I first used it, I made a pot on the normal setting and the coffee had a funny chemical taste to it but I then tried it on the strong setting and the chemical taste was not there. So we always use the strong setting for our coffee and no issues. The timer gave me great peace of mind about leaving the house and not worrying about my son turning off the coffee pot when he was done. It turns off after 2 hours but you can push a button and it will extend another 2 hours. It is stylish looking and easy to clean."
Rich in Va,4.0,"March 19, 2013","I purchased this to replace a much more expensive Cuisinart that kept getting clogged up after only 4 months no matter how much I cleaned it.  The coffee tastes great and the machine is pretty easy to use.  I noticed the plastic odor that some have referred to but it never made its way into my coffee and the odor stopped after a few uses.  I would definitely recommend this machine.  I would also recommend the permanent filter, it makes loading the grounds a lot easier.Some have mentioned slow brew times.  I've owned a few different Mr. Coffee's and one Cuisinart and I'd say they are all fairly comparable in that regard.  This machine can be set to start on a timer so worst case you can program it to start brewing based on whatever time you wake up in the morning."
Musiclady,5.0,"June 18, 2014",I purchased this after doing online research for the best coffee maker. Consumer Reports rated this one as one their top pics. I couldn't believe the price--so reasonable. My husband loves Starbucks coffee. He wanted the same taste at home that he could get at the coffee shop. One of the keys is getting the water hot enough for the brew. So going on Consumer Reports advice I bought it. My husband said it is as close to the original Starbucks coffee shop coffee that he has tasted. I also ordered Mr. Coffee DRD95 8-Cup Stainless Steel Double-Walled Thermal Carafe. My husband says the coffee stays hotter longer and is be is better than the glass container that sits on the heating element.
P. Steff,5.0,"May 11, 2013","I had to replace my old coffeemaker. I'm not a huge coffee drinker nor do I need a coffeemaker with all of the bells & whistles so I purchased a different brand name coffeemaker before this. It made the worst tasting coffee I ever had! I decided to give this one a try. I have only used it for a few weeks but I so far I am really pleased with this coffeemaker. I have used all of the features except for the thermal pot. First off I have to say it is much more attractive then what I expected. People have already commented on that. One thing that surprised me was that a lot of steam did not come pouring out from the top of it while the coffee was brewing. May not be a big deal for some but my last two pots always had a lot of steam coming out.The coffee is nice & hot. One of my favorite features is the 2 hour shut-off feature. Personally I didn't really notice too much of a difference in the strength of the coffee when I selected ""strong brew"". I would have preferred that the clock would be illuminated, Definitely miss that feature. I have to slide the coffeemaker out from under the cabinet to prepare it & I was pleasantly surprised that it slid very easily. All around I find that I am very pleased with this purchase & the price was very affordable."
S. Schoenholtz,5.0,"February 24, 2013","This coffee pot is just the right size for my counter, easy to fill and use, and has a regular or strong setting for the coffee, plus delayed start, etc. We've only had the machine for about 2 months, bought after out Cuisinart finally got so frustrating to use because it kept shutting off all the time (even though we religiously cleaned the thing with vinegar.....urrgh!), so it's relatively new to us. But the coffee tastes good, it's easy to use, and has been reliable. The only thing I don't like about it is the shiny chrome trim, which my husband and I keep saying we're going to take a steel wool pad to so that it will be a brushed finish (haven't done it yet). The chrome is too bright, and I like my appliances to sort of fade into the background."
Gayle Wayne,1.0,"June 12, 2015","If I hadn't dumped the box I would send this piece of ----- back. If I could give it no stars I would. The coffee tastes like burnt plastic and I tried the vinegar trick, changed filter brands, etc.I would rather drink instant coffee than what comes out of this!  It comes with a filter for water but no instructions. You cannot read the teeny clock insert without a flashlight in my kitchen. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS! After three weeks the coffee is still undrinkable and a disgusting plastic burning odor fills the house. I gave it to the Goodwill this morning. Enough said."
Silent Jay,5.0,"December 29, 2013","It's extremely simple to use, looks great, and makes good coffee (well it's at least on par with starbucks and the like).  I was going to try a french press or another similar gizmo, but this was for my parents and they needed something simple to use.  Yes, you might get better coffee taste from a french press, but this one suits us just fine (ignorance is bliss right).  The coffee is good; simple as that.  Pick up a coffee grinder, a nice batch of fresh beans from trader joes or your favorite roaster, some quality coffee filters (cone shaped ones don't fit, but if you fold them on the bottom they'll work fine - i got them at TJ), and you'll be set.When you unpackage the machine you will smell the ""burnt plastic"".  But I found that after washing and cycling water by itself, and after a cycle with coffee beans, the smell is barely present (and certainly I do not taste it)."
Dinah,5.0,"August 31, 2012",I broke the carafe on my 15 year old Mr Coffee in July and decided it was time for a new one.  I've been a skeptic of filtration devices for coffeemakers but am sold now.  The one that came with the machine does a good job and my coffee is noticeably less bitter.  Note: You don't need to use the filtration disk in addition to the regular coffee filter - it's optional. This coffeemaker is easy to use and easy to clean.  The paper filter holder basket removes and the button on the bottom can be depressed so you can rinse the drip hole.  So far no negatives except that it's a bit taller than my old one and when the top lid is up it doesn't quite fit under the cupboards and needs to be pulled forward for adding water and coffe.  All in all well worth the money.
Amazon Customer,2.0,"December 13, 2013","I will give it 2 stars because yes it does make coffee. I read a lot of the reviews that talked about a plastic smell. I thought these people may just be sensitive to odors or somehow allergic. However when I opened mine it smelled VERY heavily of vinyl or plastic. I ran vinegar and water through about 6 times and it still smelled. I started using it anyway and it now tastes OK but every once in awhile I still get a hint of that smell.I will keep using it for now, but this is actually the last Mr. Coffee I will ever buy as my last two, which were even more expensive units, died within 18 months. Those did not have the smell issue at least.Pros: Makes coffee, has a timer to auto brew in the AMCons: smells like a plastics factory, no temp control for the burner underneath, and the cheap ""chrome"" bubbled and scuffed on the first use."
Andrea,4.0,"January 15, 2017","Ordered this almost exactly 4 years ago and expect to have for at least another 4. Works great- like the 2 hour heating time and auto shut off as well as the handy ""cleaning"" function. We almost always set the brew to ""strong"": which works well. Only drawback is that the pause and serve function has never worked very well: it will always dribble some and then scorch the hot plate so that we end up just waiting until the whole brewing process is finished even if we'd rather not... Overall a good buy and has held up very well. Good tasting coffee."
GreenEng,1.0,"November 24, 2016","We owned the previous similar for many years.  It finally gave out and we had been so satisfied with that one we purchased another.  But it only lasted about 1.5 years, brewing got longer and longer until over an hour.  Looked like the check valve was defective and leaky, and temperature control kept shutting off during brewing.  Took a chance and got another one - SAME ISSUES less than a year later!  Never again will I buy a Mr Coffee brand, they should know better by now with the millions of coffee makers they've made!"
Amazon Customer,1.0,"August 30, 2016","Purchased this from Amazon on 02/17/2016. We brew nearly every day, atleast a half pot.I noticed very quickly that its brew time slowed significantly, rather quickly. Most new coffee pots hold up well before needing to clean them out to get a faster brew. The coffee maker brews slowly and beeps long before it is done. I've cleaned it multiple times with vinegar and a cleaner on occasion.Well, it is dead. Two days ago, it just quit brewing. No warming, no trying to brew, nothing... Still has power. Warranty process is a joke! Do they have any idea what it is like to go a few days without coffee? The monster in me has awoken. Shhhh.We'll just go back to spending $10 on a coffee maker that we can get more than a few months out of. Not waste our money on machines like this!"
Louie Kaufman,2.0,"November 19, 2016","I purchased this coffee maker in March, 2015.  The first one sent was defective as the coffee maker did not detect the carafe.  They sent me a replacement, which worked fine until the beginning of November, 2016, when the water no longer flowed into the coffee basket.  When I emailed the manufacturer, they said the next one I purchase would not have a problem.  No offer to send me another one, as it only had a one year warranty.  Very poor customer service as I think a coffee maker should last more than 1 year, 9 months."
Paul Walther,5.0,"August 11, 2013","I've been using a French press coffee maker for a while and well I am so happy to be back to using a traditional American style coffee drip machine.  There's no messy sediment, the coffee is delicious, and I like how it even came with a water filter to boot.  It has great features liked timed brew (although I haven't used it I'm glad it's there).  I use the normal setting.  The coffee strength is perfect for me.A concern for me was the carafe and this one doesn't spill.  The cheapo one I have at work spills constantly and I only pour with it over the sink but this one is pretty easy to control and I haven't had any problems.I am really really pleased with this purchase."
Dick P,4.0,"October 6, 2016","Stopped heating water just a month or two over the 1-year warranty. A fair number of reviews detailing early failure!  Bought another, but added the $5 3-year extended warranty. Maybe I'll be able to get three $35 coffeemakers for only $70 ;(As an engineer, I'm a bit in awe of their designers- in 35 years, don't think I was ever able to pin failure of product to warranty length that closely!Worked fine as a coffeemaker, but an expensive choice."
The Original KCVS,4.0,"August 12, 2013","I usually take a ""buy it once, spend whatever it costs to get the best one, keep it forever"" philosophy, but reality got in the way after a recent move when we found ourselves 3000 miles from home with no coffee pot and limited funds.  After a good bit of research we settled on this Mr. Coffee model and we have been so pleased that we did.  For a very reasonable price we got higher-end features like a water filter and moving ""shower head-style"" system which spreads the water over the beans evenly, producing a tastier cup of coffee.  No weird plastic taste like some of the more inexpensive coffee pots have, a generous carafe (we chose the glass one) and it is very easy to set up and use the first time.  Love the timer feature - waking up to freshly brewed coffee beats a groggy walk/drive to Starbucks any day.  Would buy again and definitely recommend."
C Cox,2.0,"June 5, 2015","I received this today, and my impression is that Mr. Coffee tried to make a good coffee maker with the cheapest possible materials to keep the price low but still make a profit. Unfortunately, the cheap materials resulted in a coffee maker with good features such as a timer and auto-shutoff, but one that ultimately makes bad coffee, and looks and feels cheaply made. After cleaning the coffee maker, I used the machine once and immediately noticed the burning plastic smell about which others have complained. That smell did diminish as I used it, but never completely went away. Worse, I do think it makes the coffee taste like plastic as well."
Monks,4.0,"June 13, 2014","In our house it's typical for us to make two pots a day and we go through a lot of coffee makers. So far this one has worked like a champ. The well is easy to pour into and there aren't drips or lose handles on the pot. The basket and holder are easy to clean, and the swing away dripper is a nice feature.The only draw backs have been that we always have to use the strong setting, but it's nice to have this feature. The water filter and holder is a bit flimsy and has already been lost, but we haven't noticed a change in the taste of the coffee. If your water needs to be filtered then it's best to use a pitcher filter to help with mineral build up anyway."
Nadia Dominique Kimber,4.0,"February 25, 2015","I LOVE my new coffee machine. I have had it for a month and haven't had any problems so far. I can program it for the next morning, or I can turn it on whenever I want to. It never puts grounds in the coffee, and comes with a filter to filter your water. It comes with the glass container, not the thermal one, as you can purchase that separately. The stainless steel doesn't look cheap. Easy to fill with filter and coffee grounds. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because it said it was a no-drip machine where if you took the glass pot out it wouldn't drip. I was excited for this feature, but it does in fact still drip. But I would still recommend this coffee maker."
ActionT,3.0,"February 25, 2014",(Original review. Downgraded as of today): I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  Her coffee is piping hot and ready to drink when she gets up in the morning. If she's happy ... I'm happy.Update: This machine was perfect until this morning (not quite a year after buying it).  I did everything as usual but it simply decided to do nothing.  The lights and clock work but it won't brew coffee.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I paid around $35.00 and it almost lasted a year.  Another win for corporate America and another loss for the consumer. Will buy a new one today but not this brand.
Gary J. Landman,2.0,"January 17, 2014","I had an older Mr. Coffee model we liked a lot, so when it was time for a new one I read the reviews and chose this highly rated model. From the beginning, the ""strong brew"" button didn't seem to work. It would go off in a few seconds and the 3 beeps that indicate the brewing is finished would sound. Rereading the reviews I found a few people have the same problem. Now the good news...I called 1-800-mrcoffee and the representative was very nice. She said it was a problem that model has had, but since mine was under warranty she was sending me a new one for free and a mailing label to send back the defective one. So Mr. Coffee is a great company but this model has some problems."
Amazon Customer,2.0,"November 7, 2016","Worked efficiently for the past year and four months, meaning it made us coffee when we asked it to.  At some point, the clock fogged over, so programming it, or finding out what time it was while I was standing it front of it, was not an option.  Well, this Saturday morning, at 5am, getting ready for our YARDSALE, it stopped working.  The light came on, as if it were GOING to give us coffee, but it never happened.  We even wondered if we might have accidentally set it for a delayed brew, but all weekend, no coffee.  So, I had seen very similar one star reviews with similar issues, where Mr. Coffee (himself?), was like, CALL ME! I WANT TO WORK THIS OUT!  So I called, and explained the situation, giving ""him"" my model number and reading codes off of the plug prongs.  I was told that the item was a few months out of warranty, but didn't want to leave a bad review of a resolution was possible, as it was clearly an ongoing issue with this model.  Alas, ""he"" could only offer me free shipping on a similar model.  PASS.  It looks like the newer similar models have newer similar issues! At least ""he's"" consistent?  Currently looking at somewhat pricier, but hopefully more reputable, Cuisinart coffee makers."
chris o,5.0,"August 2, 2015","Ordered this one to replace our last Mr. Coffee pot that died after 7 years of use.  Easy to use right out of the box, wash the main parts, run a cycle of water through the pot and ready to brew.  The instruction manual has a guide on how much coffee (Tablespoons) per cup you should use, but I like my coffee a bit strong, the pot does have an option to brew a stronger cup also which helps me out.  There is a delay timer for setting your brew up the night before so it is ready to pour in the morning before you leave for work.  If you are looking for an easy pot to use that makes coffee and does not break the bank then go ahead and add this one to the cart, you won't be disappointed."
Am Azon Woman,5.0,"August 17, 2015","I read the review for this coffee maker after looking for a replacement for my 8 year old Cuisinart, and at first was hesitant because I fancy myself a coffee snob. The reviews said this machine brewed with a hotter water temp, allowing greater extraction of the beans, etc etc. and all that other technical mumbo jumbo, so for $35 I gave it a shot (plus it had speedy delivery and saved me a trip to Walmart or Costco).Bottom line: It brews better coffee than my Cuisinart ever did. I'd buy this again. Well played, Mr. Coffee!"
JMC,3.0,"July 26, 2013","I can't believe with all the good reviews this maker has this problem. The water and grinds back up close to overflow and I end up with coffee grinds above the filter and in the coffee being brewed. I looked while it was brewing and the water was right up to the top. Why isn't it draining into the glass pot faster? I found some Brunn paper filters that are 2-3/4"" tall instead of 2-3/8 but still there were some coffee grinds over, not very many though. With that taller filter I can't use the water filter which is cheesy anyway just sitting on top of filter. Maybe I will just make fewer cups and less water and coffee grinds to go wild.All in all it is better than the maker I had before."
S. McElroy,4.0,"August 24, 2013","I like this coffeemaker for the price.  I decided to buy it simply because we had this old classic coffeemaker (that worked just fine), but it didn't have the programmable timed-brew feature that I wanted.  I think this looks sharp - it looks great in our kitchen.  I love the square shape of it, and it's really pretty easy to use.  The only feature I haven't figured out without looking at the book is how to pause mid-brew to fill up your cup!  The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars -- there's very little room for you to pour the water in the back of the coffeemaker.  It hasn't been a mess yet, but I'm waiting for the day when I miss pouring by just 1/4 of an inch and I've soaked my kitchen counter.  Also, the filter on top of the filter basket is really just rather weird.  Either way, I'd recommend it to a friend if they're looking for something without a thousand bells and whistles."
Amanda Forest,5.0,"August 30, 2015","We own two of these.  They both perform very well (daily).  I've not had any issues with this coffee-maker.  Honestly, we haven't noticed any weird smells when using it.  When we got them out of the box, we ran a couple cycles of hot water through first.The water filters are easy to use and easy to replace.  Although I can't really taste the difference when using the filters.I did try the permanent basket filter for this model, but went back to the paper ones promptly.  I noticed a big difference in the taste of the coffee when I used the permanent basket filter (and not a good taste)....so paper it is."
Anadeel,2.0,"February 15, 2016","Sorta disappointed with this coffeemaker.  The coffee just doesn't taste that good.  Definitely noticeable difference in the flavor compared to our old Bunn. It does operate just fine and we've had no problems with how it functions - pretty straight forward and easy to use.  However, the taste of the coffee seems ""off"".  We left the lid open to try to air out the plastic smell, but that scent remains strong in the reservoir.  Maybe that has affected the taste.  (We use good quality coffee, often fresh-grinding the beans)"
T. Smith,4.0,"April 3, 2014","Just received this coffee pot and have been able to use it a few times.  Coffee tastes great.  Easy to use. Nicely designed. As others have noted, of course it smells like plastic when you take it out of the box. I washed with soap and water, ran vinegar and water and then just plain water through it before I made coffee. No more plastic smell.  It's not difficult to pour the water in the holding tank (at least not for me anyhow).  The strong and regular brew options work fine.  The delay option works fine.  I'm glad I chose this coffee maker to replace my Krups that died after many years of faithful service."
Keith,5.0,"January 11, 2014","We replaced a 10 year old, still working, Mr. Coffee that was essentially the predecessor to this model (old carafe still fits) only because, well, it seemed time.  We drink a LOT of good coffee - at least one pot every day, and often 2 or 3.  We've had many different brands and filter styles, but these things work, and you just can't beat the price.Like the previous model, the lid, when raised, means this does not fit underneath cabinets, if that is an issue.  You also need to fill water at the back, so while you can store it under cabinets against the wall, you cannot conveniently use it in that kind of location, in case that's a consideration."
sst4270,5.0,"November 5, 2013","First: It's a $40 coffee machine. So don't expect too much. My previous 10 yr old machine, a Cuisinart, died recently.Regarding some of the negative reviews.Yes, it ships in its retail box; however, the carafe is well protected by soft foam pads.My carafe does not drip when I pour a cup  or fill the machine unlike some other reviewers complained. It pours great!  (possibly manufacturing inconsistancies when the carafes are formed)I find it hard to understand why people were having trouble filling the machine. Like most standard coffemakers... You lift the lid and pour water in the back. Simple. No leaks. There are a couple of holes in the back of the machine near the top (above the fill line). I suppose if you are just (not smarter than a 5th grader) you might get water all over your counter by trying to pour more than 12 cups into the machine.I followed the directions and ran two full pots of plain water through the machine before my first pot of coffee. After the first pot of water I did notice a very slight 'plastic' odor. By the second pot of water the odor was gone. From the first pot of coffee to now (two weeks and 14 pots later) I've noticed no such odor in my coffee.I don't use the 'water filter' thats meant to sit on top of the coffee filter (weird/poor design IMHO) because I use filtered water from my frig.I set the clock. Set the timer. And every morning there's a delicious fresh pot of coffee waiting for me.Yes it beeps when the pot is ready and yes it beeps two hours later when it's about to shut off. My Cuisinart did that so I'm used to it.When you lift the lid you'll notice that the hot water spout is directly over the center of the coffee filter holder. It rotates out of the way so you can empty and fill the coffee filter. It is ever so slightly annoying that you have to move it out of the way (remember $40 machine). However, there's a little tab in the lid that moves the spout back into place when you close the lid just in case you forget to do so.The front is chrome plated plastic (kind of cheap looking) but it cleans easily and still looks better than plain black plastic.As it's only been two weeks I can't comment on long term reliability, but as with so many things these days I expect something to go wrong with the electronics or switches before anything else. So we'll see. If I get 5~10 yrs out of it I'll be happy.For $40 I think this is a well made simple coffee maker."
Az,3.0,"September 22, 2015","2 complaints.#1  The water fill line is on the side of the coffee maker, so I can't see the water level, unless I turn the unit sideways.  My previous Mr. Coffee had the fill line in the front, making it very convenient.#2 No back lighting on the clock.  It's so dark, I can't read it, so it's hard to program.  Again, my previous Mr. Coffee had a back lit clock, which made it very convenient to program as well as having an easy to read clock in that area of the kitchen.Otherwise, so far so good."
Kyt-10,5.0,"February 5, 2014","i just bought my second one of this model of coffee pot, NOT because anything at all is wrong with the first one....it doesn't leak and still makes a perfect pot of coffee. the reason i went ahead and got a second one is because the first one is almost 5 years old and most coffee pots don't last that long. in fact, i have had hundred dollar coffee pots that only made it a couple of years before leaking, etc. i got the second one because 'omg, what if my coffee pot dies...it is SO old'! so glad i could get the exact same model, best coffee pot i have ever owned. btw, i make 2-3 pots every day and it has still survived nearly FIVE YEARS!"
K. Conley,3.0,"November 21, 2015","I purchased this item about two years ago and was very happy with it until about three months ago when I cleaned it with a dilute vinegar solution and it proceeded to have an extended epic melt-down. Every time that I brew now water somehow gets onto the hotplate and boils over onto the counter which necessitates a diaper (of sorts) to keep things contained. I don't know how those two things are related (correlation doesn't equal causation after all) but that was the sequence of events. I am debating buying another one, as it is remarkably cheap, and expecting less than two years out of it or moving on to a more expensive model in hopes that I won't have to."
J Lind,5.0,"January 17, 2014","I ordered an expensive Cuisinart coffee maker (voted number 1 for 2013), and in three days it stopped working. Very disappointed I went back to Mr. Coffee and started looking for a new coffee maker, reasonably priced I found this one. I have never been happier, it works perfectly for my husband who goes to work at 4am and the delay option for him is great. It keeps the coffee warm enough for me when I get up at 6am with my three children. I couldn't be happier with this coffee maker. I love Mr. Coffee and I will continue to use this one until it goes Kaput.  Love it and hope this review helps others who are looking at expensive coffee makers."
Bilko,2.0,"April 17, 2014","Brews coffee just fine, but I've had some issues with the electronics. For instance, the manual claims that once you set the brew strength to ""strong"" (my preference), it will remember and default to it in the future. It doesn't - not a big deal, but it means pressing an extra button every time I use it. More annoying is that when set to ""strong"", it starts to brew for a few seconds, then the sensor decides it's finished brewing for some reason, gives the beep-beep that it's ready, and turns off the ""brewing"" light. Luckily, it still continues brewing coffee after this, but the handy signals for when it's ready don't work right. It seems to work fine with the ""regular"" strength setting though. There are 1 or 2 other minor things like this too.I got as a replacement for a previous Mr. Coffee maker that broke, and it did not have these weird issues. Not sure why it would have changed for the worse with a new model. I would probably buy a different brand if I had to do this over again."
LawnGirl,1.0,"November 14, 2015","I bought this coffee pot thinking it would be similar quality to the other Mr. Coffee pots I've owned. There's no pause n pour feature and it makes the coffee too hot so it almost always tastes burnt. Also you can't turn the burner off so you're pretty much guaranteed to have burnt coffee. I've only owned this pot for 4 months and I already need a replacement. I've had other Mr. Coffee makers last for years. Don't waste your money, go ahead and spend the extra $10 for the FTX model. They are great!"
Dee,1.0,"February 7, 2014",I think I have had this coffee maker for about 6 months now and it is officially being replaced today as soon as I order another! My main frustrating issue is that you evidently need the precision of a brain surgeon in order to place the carafe in the maker for it to brew correctly. If the carafe is not in properly (a 1to 3 odds for me) the coffee maker will overflow hot liquid and grounds all over. It's to the point I have to watch it (like this morning) because I doubt my placement. Other than that the coffee brews fine I guess but again I have 2/3 chance at a regular non-grounds cup of coffee:(
Jim in Sebastopol,5.0,"September 10, 2013","I'm a patient man and can wait for my coffee but if you're riding the underbelly of a hang over or your dream version of what death might be like, you need your coffee quick when you awaken.My routine is to put the dishes away in the morning so I thought there was an exploding volcano behind me while I was doing so today. My new coffee pot was working so furiously to deliver me a hot brew I thought something was wrong.It wasn't everything was right with the world. It was just in a hurry to please me, like my dog, Clare always is.Great choice in coffee makers. Thank you Amazon Prime for making my life so much easier."
dale,1.0,"April 8, 2014","Worked fine for a while.  However, when you lift the lid every day to fill the unit, a couple ounces of ""old"" water that gets trapped somewhere in the lid gets dumped into the reservoir.  Since I used it daily, the water wasn't too old or funky so I could live with that.  But, after about 3 months I noticed the plastic window for the clock was all fogged up making the clock unreadable.  Therefore, if you ever unplug the unit, or the power goes out, it is rendered useless as a programable coffeemaker.  In another week or so, the clock window was full of water - totally useless.  Days later the unit stopped working completely.  When pressing the ""on"" button, the lights just flashed intermitently for a while, then went off.  So now, 4 moths after purchase, the unit is totally dead.  This is about 10 weeks past the ""able to return date.""  It is now headed for the landfill.  Buyer beware!"
Jamie V,2.0,"July 13, 2016","I have had nothing but problems with coffee makers.  I thought this one would be better because of the reviews, but this one only gave us about a couple of months of good coffee making.  Now the water goes all over the counter. It doesn't make a full pot of coffee even though I fill it to the 12 cup line and grounds tend to disperse throughout the maker.Update! It has been less than five months, and now are coffee pot is dead. It no longer brews coffee. I'm very very disappointed!"
Cderrick0174,1.0,"August 28, 2016","Can't use the water filter. It resulted in my counter and ther appliances being flooded. I miss my Gavalia.Update: This thing is a piece of garbage. I have used it three times in probably 6months. This is because it floods everytime I try. Today, on my off day, I brewed 8 cups and when I walked in after the alarm, there was only one cup of coffe and grounds on my counter. I opened the top and the filter was full of coffee and grounds. What a freaking mess. I am not a happy nurse right now. We need our coffee."
S. Brooks,3.0,"January 23, 2016","We purchased this Mr Coffee in June of 2015, and it worked as described until November of 2015, when it suddenly stopped working. The lights would come on when we pressed the button, but the heating element wouldn't. It just sat, useless. We took it apart, to see if something had come loose, or if it had a fuse that blew, but didn't find anything wrong. So, after in just over 6 months, we had to throw it away. Here's the really sad part;  my wife went to a big discount store and bought another, less fancy, Mr Coffee maker, and within 2 months it's started acting strange too. That brand's just not made to the quality it used to."
Amazon Customer,4.0,"September 12, 2011","I make coffee every morning. It's one spot I'll spend a bit more for a device to make it a better experience.On the + side...1. It's fast. I don't know how, but even on 'strong' mode, this thing makes my pot of coffee before I finish putting on my socks/shoes and making a cup of yogurt. Very nice.2. As others noticed, it does look very modern with pretty button colors.3. Very simple to use.4. Pot seems to be easy to pour (no drips/spills).Things I found a bit off...1. The water filter thingy is above the coffee grounds. I have big meat-hook fingers that I need to pinch the filter onto the top without dropping it into the grounds. I have become more nimble at this so now it's just a nuisance because I have 3 things to wash in the morning before brewing (water filter, grounds holder, and pot).2. Not a cone drip. I had a cone drip. Is it better? I don't know. But, psychologically, I always thought the coffee filtering through a larger % of coffee grounds might give me better coffee. Again, that's probably not true. I noticed most places (Starbucks) use a flat filter. So, it's my own hangup. You can probably ignore this. I've compensated by using twice the amount of coffee when I brew. Actually, I think I'm using the same amount but I never really measured.3. Shiny metal vs. brushed. Most metal in our kitchen is a flat/dull brushed aluminum. This uses a shiny metal. Just FYI as it may go against your Feng shui.I didn't notice any off taste but I ran two pots of water before I ever used it.Could you pay more for a better maker? Probably. But, I don't know which one that would be. You'd be better off with better coffee grounds, better filters, and better water than spending more on another maker. I'd be the first to buy a better coffee machine that is ... actually better.I've had it a month, no problems and I think this is a keeper at a great price. I can't give it 5 stars because I don't 'love' it -- but, I sure do like it."
scrognoid,3.0,"April 7, 2012","It was great as long as it lasted.  The first one somehow got moisture into the digital clock display so I could not see to set the timer.  This happened after just a couple of months and Amazon sent me a new one.  The new one did the same thing after a couple more months and now it's too late to get a warranty replacement.The design is good.  The controls, while not intuitive are at least simple.  The coffee tastes good (and I am finicky about this.)  But QC seems to have broken down in this one area.  Too bad.  I liked this machine while it worked."
J.Nelson,5.0,"February 8, 2014","The purchase was to replace a different brand coffee maker that couldn't keep itself from leaking all over my counter.  Going back to the basics of Mr. Coffee was a terrific decision.Some of the high points are:- Automatic detection of glass or thermal carafe.- 2 Brew strengths- Very easy to program and use- Coffee is hot and tasty- Seems well made (button response, etc.)- Pause and serve works wellThere are a couple of things I'd change but they're only minor annoyances for me.- Would be nice if the clock was backlit.- I'd like a way to turn off the 3 loud beeps when the cycle is finished. I set the timer and the beeps wake up the whole house in the morning.Overall I highly recommend this for a pain-free pot of coffee.."
Howard Reed,4.0,"April 10, 2015","Been using it for a few months now, works fine. It's a sub 30 dollar coffee pot so there's nothing to write home about.It does what you would expect, brews middle of the road coffee like most any sub 150.00 electric coffee pot.After several expensive Bunn coffee pots failed on me within a couple years I decided to go cheap.It doesn't brew as good of a cup of coffee as my old Bunn velocity brew, but I suspect it will last much longer and was less than 1/4 of the price of the bunn it replaced."
Joshua Boyer,2.0,"August 26, 2015","Mine must be broke. I haven't seen this anywhere else but mine constantly registers the glass pot as thermal. I thought there was a sensor on the machine but it's actually based on water level when you fill up. My wife and I just want to have about 3 or 4 cups a day total between us, but the the water level sensor for glass is for 10 or 12 cups. So we have been trying to make more than we need because the coffee maker shuts off before we finish our first cup- A feature for thermal.  So now even with the extra needed to register glass it still only registers thermal and shuts off.Grrr. I called Mr. Coffee and spoke to a very matter-of-fact rep who told me essentially that's just the way it is. Thanks a lot! I threw the box away so I now I have to buy another coffee maker. Bet it's not Mr. COFFEE ; )"
JennB,5.0,"November 27, 2012","I replaced my Cuisinart with this about two months ago and found it to be as advertised and reflective of most of the other reviews. Attractive unit that brews an excellent pot of coffee.  I retired 13 years ago from the Navy as a Senior Chief Petty Officer. I like a good cup of Joe that can be construed as a bit strong. My wife enjoys her coffee at a more civilized and non- nuclear level. This machine accommodates both. It does have one minor flaw in that the pot dribbles a bit when pouring. This small flaw can, however, be mitigated by thumbing open the lid while pouring your coffee."
Pachysandra,3.0,"March 24, 2014","Previously had a Mr Coffee FTX41 which worked great for two years then just quit.Have had this one for a month.  Makes good coffee, but I have to reset the strength from regular to strong EVERY time I make coffee, whether immediate or delayed, contrary to what manual states.Also, it beeps when coffee making starts and when the heater goes off.  Previous coffee maker beeped when coffee was ready and when heater went off.  Much more logical.  Know it's a little thing; usually start is delayed and I'm not in the room but when I start the coffee and it beeps when it begins to heat the water, it is irritating.  I know, ""Get a life!""Anyway, coffee is good which is the most important thing."
Mister C,4.0,"January 1, 2015","Makes a very good cup of coffee. I use a reusable filter instead of paper. I also don't use the water filter and coffee is still very good. I didn't seed the need as I use spring water for coffee and filters can get expensive. The programming took as little bit to figure out, but one I did, I've had no problems with it. Internally, you have to swing the arm that pours the water over the coffee to the source to remove the filter and basket.I like the brew strength selection as I like my coffee on the strong side."
Jeff,3.0,"January 5, 2014","This pot works just fine, though nothing really special.  We were hoping its finish would be closer to the stainless look of the Mr Coffee Burr Mill Grinder in the same line, but it really is shiny chrome.  The ""strong brew"" button does actually make a stronger pot!And here's an update! After about 4 years of admirable service our Mr Coffee sprung a slow leak in the water reservoir and had to be replaced.  But we liked it so well, we replaced with the exact same model.  Well, almost exact--this one has a little beeper that tells you when the brew is completed."
R. Milward,1.0,"May 13, 2017","Bought this in Aug 2015 to be used on weekends for just 6 months out of the year.  So it did not get much use.  One morning it just did not brew coffee, the lights were on, it was filled with water and nothing!  Called customer service and was told it was a heating element and there were no replacement parts and it was only warranted for 1 year.  So I am out of luck.  Check Mr. Coffee's web page to see all the people with the same complaint.  Think I'll go back to the black and decker!"
Liza Jane,2.0,"May 25, 2016","Purchased in September 2015, and it died May 25, 2016.  Before it died, it was okay.  Wish the warmer would have kept the coffee hotter.  Before its final pot, the coffee maker would signal that the pot was ready, when in fact it was only half way through.  It worked this morning, but when I tried to make a pot after work, the pump did not work.  All the lights were on, but no water coming through.  Turned it on and off a few times, but it is just dead.  So it worked about 8 months."
Mamazon,5.0,"August 26, 2012",I was reluctant to buy this product due to comments about coffee flowing out all over the countertop.  I purchased also the 8 cup thermal carafe
kaydee,5.0,"August 26, 2015","We purchased the Mr. Coffee to replace a Cuisinart that had stopped working after several years.  We'd paid about $100 for the Cuisinart.  After reading the reviews online and in Consumer Report, we decided to purchase the Mr. Coffee and have been pleasantly surprised by it.  There's nothing about it that we don't like and we feel that the coffee brewed in the Mr. Coffee has a better flavor than coffee that was brewed in our Cuisinart.  The appliance is attractive, easy to program and easy to clean.  So far, no complaints from us."
Active Engineer,1.0,"February 20, 2012","I went off a consumer reports recommendation and purchased this maker.  It doesn't heat the water near enough.  I could chug a cup without even burning my mouth, so there's no way it's making the coffee well.  You can even put your hand under the water as it's hitting the beans, and it doesn't burn your hand.  The Carafe also leaks.  I did a side by side comparison with an older maker I bought this one to replace.  Same beans, same grind, same volume, and this new maker makes a weak underwhelming cup of coffee.  Usually consumer reports is spot on, but in this case they were way off.  I'll be buying a replacement from another company."
CK,4.0,"July 22, 2015","Okay, I like the basic functionality of this unit (four stars), but this is my second unit in a year and a half.  The first unit developed some sort of a leak in the reservoir when brewing started.  We're power users, 7 days a week, sometimes 2 pots a day with family over so the unit was used constantly.  The first unit was out of warranty and based on the decent experience (and primarily price) I pulled the trigger on a new one.  Hopefully this one will last, dare I say, 2 years..."
Alicia,1.0,"May 18, 2015","VERY weak coffee, we have to use about 1.5 as much coffee for same strength, but even more frustrating, the dang machine leaked all over the counter and onto the floor yesterday morning. Hoping it was an operator error, we tried making another serving this morning and the same thing happened. No clogs, no cracks, nothing wrong with the machine. It should be mentioned that the coffee maker-as well as other devices in our house- are well taken care of and cleaned regularly. The machine was only 10 months old.Nice looking though."
Jan,4.0,"March 30, 2014","This coffeemaker looks handsome on the counter and makes decent coffee. I use it with the glass carafe - it also supports brewing directly into a thermal carafe that is available for purchase separately.  I love that I can get my first cup from it while it is still brewing (delay feature, I think it is called).  It has a nice, wide area for pouring the water into the reservoir which is handy.  My only complaints are that it is a bit noisy as it brews - it makes loud gurgling sounds until it is finished.  And the heating surface seems to get extremely hot, altho' it has not adversely affected the flavor of the coffee."
TJ M,5.0,"October 7, 2013","Wonderful coffee maker I purchased last Christmas, and it has lasted the test of time! Love, love, love the fact that it buzzes when it's done brewing, and that you can adjust the settings if you wish to.Be careful when filling up with water, if you over fill it you will create a big mess. Grounds will over flow... It's not fun! And make sure that the filter basket is lined up ... And everything is in its place.I like it because if you are anxious and want a cup--before it's brewing, you can do so and it stops brewing... Then it continue when you put the crafe back in it's place."
Landon Brangley,5.0,"December 7, 2011","This coffee maker was shipped at the speed of light!  Major kudos to Amazon for handling this order expeditiously!  I don't know what people are talking about with the plastic taste.  I didn't taste any plastic, because I cleaned the coffee maker with a cycle of white vinegar first.  Sure it smelled like plastic initially, but that's because it's made of plastic!  The first pot of coffee I brewed was absolutely outstanding.  The filtration disk does a great job in cleaning the water before it hits the ground coffee.  The machine even looks good on my counter!  My only complaint is that the clock on front of the machine is not back lit, but all the other features outweigh this issue.  My last coffee maker was also a Mr. Coffee brand.  I got it my first year of college, and it's still working just fine, so I trust this one will last long as well.  It's a great coffee maker for a great price!"
CrazyGirlOnABike,1.0,"March 10, 2016","This thing had an absolutely AWFUL chemical smell when I first opened it. I ran about 8 pots of water through and it was still there but decided to go ahead and brew some coffee - it was weak (even with a ton of grounds and on the ""strong"" setting) and it tasted like plastic. Then all of the buttons on the front died the next day. Totally useless. Luckily I bought it from Amazon and they are great about returns - now I'm looking for a new coffee maker...."
Halfdome Gnome,2.0,"September 20, 2015","Bought this to replace another Mr Coffee that was working, but the buttons were sticking a little.  It worked great...'worked' being the key word.  Bought on April 20, 2015, received on April 22, and used on April 23.  This morning (Sept 20) it's stopped cold...not even the heating plate is working.  Luckily we kept the old coffeemaker so plugged it in and we have coffee.  Looking into the return policy."
inapapercup,4.0,"August 20, 2013","I read about the ""plasticky"" taste in other reviews, so I ran this coffee maker twice with plain water and was fine. This coffee maker does what it's supposed to. I am especially pleased with the ""strong"" brew button, which makes the water coming out of the spout come out slower, resulting in a stronger tasting brew. I had a hard time figuring out how to set the delay because i lost my instructions (by the way you have to set it, and then turn the coffee maker on and off, and then the delay light will come on meaning it's set) but you can google this coffee maker's name and there are YouTube videos of people setting it.I used to use a Chemex, and I got tired of the difficulty of making more than 2 cups of coffee in a single go, and didn't really feel like I was getting coffee that tasted that much better (yes, I am aware there are techniques for doing it right), but in my busy/lazy life, a regular old press-one-button-and-voila-coffee set up is much much more practical. Plus, the fact that machine keeps the coffee warm after I walk away is also a god-send. So here's to waking up at 6am and having a warm, strongish cup of coffee ready for you!"
Ashley,1.0,"January 24, 2014","I bought this because of the great rating it received in Consumer Reports, but something must have changed in the manufacture of this coffee maker between the CR rating and now, because it made the worst coffee I have ever tasted. It really did taste like airplane coffee. I followed the directions for cleaning it, used the included water filtration device, and my first batch was undrinkable. So I cleaned it again. Next batch, same chemical taste. The third and final brew, I used more coffee, thinking that might help, but I could still taste the plastic above all other flavors. I sent it back to Amazon today for a refund. A coffee maker shouldn't need to be broken in before it makes good coffee."
EaglesfanWPHS,5.0,"March 1, 2012","Up till now, I was using a free coffee pot offer from a mail order coffee supplier.  However, when reading all the high reviews from this item and knowing how a good cup of coffee in the morning is needed to start my  day, made this purchase.  Best coffee maker ever bought.  The coffee is the perfect temp perfect flavor and the preset is a great feater.  Sold on this and would highly reccommend it to anyone looking for a good cup of coffee at a fair price.  I did see the time at a discount store for the same price when did mke the ship charges a bit high, however, my choice to pay it for the convenience of not driving anywhere to purchase it."
Ali Hatamizadeh,5.0,"March 14, 2015","OK, So I am a PhD student and spend much of my time in the lab, and I am like 40 percent less efficient if I don't drink coffee in the morning and in the afternoon. SO I broke our old coffee maker's pot by accident and I along with other guys working there decided to buy this model of Mr.Coffee. At first we thought that we are not gonna get a quality coffee maker since it sounded too fancy with all those buttons and lights for such price ( we really did not want to go beyond the budget ). But then, after we brewed the first coffee, everyone loved it! I can say it is one of the reasons why I get up early in the morning very soon to get to the lab ( I know I can buy one for myself but I am taking advantage of this strong love in some way to achieve something academically). Coffee brewed by this machine tastes better than Starbucks if you use the right coffee. It can be programmed up to 24 hours before brewing your coffee and has all bunch of other cool stuffs for different brewing options ( regular, strong). The temperature of the coffee just feels so right, not too cold or hot. Also it has a beep sound which alerts when it is done brewing ( I guess it is such a simple and useful feature that many machines don't have ). Moreover, the chlorine filter is perfect which also improves the taste of coffee.  You are avoiding a high concentration of chlorine entering into your body by a cheap filter which needs to be replaced every month. All in all, it is worth every cent which we paid for it!"
B.Stewart,5.0,"August 18, 2015","Update 13 months later:After using this daily for 13 months, my pot stopped working. I've always used filtered water. It's always clean, but now it refuses to get water from the reservoir.(Aug 2015 review:) Bought this coffee maker after my Keurig crapped out on me. This coffee maker is worth the buy. I bought the permanent reusable filter and only use distilled water. My coffee tastes lovely and I look forward to having some every morning. All functions listed work perfectly. I've had zero problems."
Ray J,5.0,"March 14, 2015","This is a very nice and high quality coffee maker. It brews good coffee and very fast with timer controls. I brew 10 cups and set the timer. It takes 10 minutes to brew this coffee. Shipping was fast and packaging was great. The original box was placed inside a larger box with air packs. Arrived quickly and in one piece. No problem pouring water into brewer, and fits on counter top under upper cabinets. Although you cannot open the lid under the top cabinets. I would think almost all people would pull maker forward to put water and grounds in."
Paul Blouin,5.0,"January 18, 2013","Every cup of coffee tastes good in this bad boy. I've had other brands before and this might make the best coffee I've ever tasted at home. Really simple machine that does what its description says what more can you ask for in a product? It's a delight to have purchased this product. AND at a reasonable price! Love it!I almost bought another machine but after checking out the filter prices I decided on the 12 cup. Filters are dirt cheap for the 12 cup but the smaller machines, not at all. You'll be buying filters consistently throughout the life of the machine so why not keep the back-end costs low? Coffee is pricey enough! Well glad I did some research on this one."
Logan,5.0,"February 8, 2015","I'm a major coffee snob. So why get a cheap coffee maker? Well, some days I'm just too lazy to constantly go through the process of my french press or stove top espresso maker (mostly the 2nd or 3rd cup, 1st cup I don't mind). So here I am buying and now writing a review. As far as this type of coffee marker goes, I love it. I've had better but I also spent $100+ on those. Additionally, my stove top espresso maker and french press make highly superior coffee but for what this is, it makes great, simple coffee and at a very attractive price."
Ace Cool,5.0,"August 17, 2015","Perfect. S T R O N G coffee with fewer grounds. If you drink your coffee within an hour, forget the carafe and get the standard glass. It will be hotter, you can make more for the same size coffee maker and they are cheap. Mr Coffee may not be as fancy as Braun or Krups but in terms of utils, it blows them away. This coffee maker set on strong makes some nice bold coffee. We use SB's Komodo Dragon, a perfect coffee for folks who like coffee coffee and not baby coffee. P E R F E C T machine, get one, get two...."
Sonar77,5.0,"February 3, 2012","I puchased this coffeemaker right after last Christmas to replace my Cuisinart DCC 1200. My Cuisinart, which was less than a year old, would not pour hot water through the lid anymore. After doing my homework on the internet, I noticed that onsumerreports.org rated this coffeemaker as their ""Best Buy"". Considering the price on amazon.com, for $39.99, which is less than 2.5 times the price of the Cuisinart, I was encouraged that you could get a quality coffemaker product for under $50.00.When I received the coffeemaker, I ran water through the system to clean and check its use. I noticed that this unit pours hot water from a rotating spout arm that moves out of place over the filter basket. I also noticed that when the lid comes down, that the rotating spout is moved back in place, due to a clever design in the lid.The taste and temperture of the coffee was similar to my Cuisinart. What makes a different in taste is using a metal filter basket in place of a paper filter. The metal filter basket allows for very fine grinds to pour thru, which gives the coffee a richer taste. I purchased the brass filter basket separately for $9.99, which does not come with the coffeemaker. I would recommend that Mr. Coffee include the metal filter basket and charge the extra $9.99 in its price.Another ""But"" is that the carafe spout drips along its body if you are not careful when pouring the coffee into a cup. See new comment below.A great feature of this coffeemaker is that you can add a thermal 8 cup carafe for $16.46. The coffeemaker has a switch which does not require the hot plate to be on when using the thermal carafe. The coffee stays hot for hours in this carafe.Pouring 12 cups of water into the top was easier than my Cuisinart, which only had a small corner opening to pour into.Considering the price, features and design, I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a good cup of coffee and wants to save a few bucks.A Year Later: My wife and I still enjoy this unit with its ease of use, easy cleanup, good tasting coffee, and adjustable features. I did learn over time that if you do not want the spout to drip, just press the cover slightly up with your thumb, so that the coffee does not come into contact with the cover."
Boston Music Fan,1.0,"October 1, 2014","I hate this coffee maker.  The first one I received did not work, right out of the box.  I promptly contacted Amazon and, as usual, they processed a replacement quickly and efficiently.  I received the second unit and it tripped my circuit breaker the first two times I tried to use it.  I was just about to return it, but I tried it one more time and it started working.  Rather than return a second unit in one week, I decided to give it a shot.  Big mistake.  It worked for the next two months but has now stopped working.  It sounds like it is about to brew but then starts pumping out steam and then straight smoke.  The pump does not appear to be working as water never flows correctly and it seems to be over heating.  I am glad it did this while I was watching because the smoke sure seemed like it was about to catch ON FIRE.  I unplugged it immediately and it stopped.  This model clearly has serious quality control issues.  I can't believe it was so well rated on consumer reports.  This is a dangerous product.  Amazon's return policy doesn't allow me to return outside of 30 days.  So, I guess I can deal with the manufacturer and try to get them to do something with this $29 piece of crap.  Do yourself a favor and stay away."
Kate,3.0,"September 27, 2017","This model has the basic functionality I would want - programmable and can be paused to pour a cup. That's all we want in a coffee maker. But it will only last 3 years. We bought it in July of 2014. In July of 2017 the carafe cracked. We bought a replacement, but now the tank leaks over night. Since we must have a coffee maker we can set up to automatically brew in the morning, it's now not useful to us at all."
JTB,1.0,"May 8, 2015","Poor. grounds plug filter and can overspill over top. The filter for the grounds plugs up and replacement paper filters you can buy are too small so grounds spill over into the brewed pot. Coffee is good if you don't mind grounds in you cup. The glass pot is very poor design, When you tip the pot the lid swings over your cup and you can't see where your pouring or how much is in your cup. Would not buy again. Have tried different filters and they are all the same. Too bad, this is not the best that Mr. Coffee has made."
mbetter,4.0,"April 25, 2015","Great coffee machine. It has all the features you need. Works great and coffee tastes great (meaning coffee tastes exactly as it's supposed to taste with it). I use it with copper filter.Pros: Value. Ease of use. No added taste or burn. Stays hot for 2 hours. Timer is nice. Easy to clean.Cons: If you fill the basket with coffee (like 8 or more spoons), it will overflow will start leaking water/coffee. So that part is bad. Since I only use 4 to 6 spoons of coffee usually, it's rarely an issue for me."
Charles L. Vogel,4.0,"June 3, 2015","A good basic coffee maker.  A few years ago it would have been an upscale machine, but timers, adjustable brew strength and other such features are so standard now.  A good accessory is the stainless steel carafe DRD95, which is made to fit this machine.  Somehow it's smart enough to know whether you're using the stainless or glass carafe, and turns off the hotplate when the stainless one is in place.  It's plastic and doesn't have the luxe feel and snob appeal of Cuisinart etc, but for the price, it can't be beat."
Eddie,5.0,"February 25, 2012","I have only had it going for 2 days now but so far this machine is like a God sent. The coffee comes out at a perfect temperature and the delay timer has been on point. The styling is sleek and the LED Lighting for features makes it look modern. The reviews about the disposable filter and the wording or lack there of best way I can explain is that you still use paper filters (I use the Melitta 8-12 Cup Filters with no problem.) When you are done you lift the lid and you take out the housing that holds the filter or you can just grab the paper coffee filter and dispose of it that way. If I find something wrong I will certainly modify my review but all I can say now is BRAVO Mr. Coffee, BRAVO."
Evie J.,5.0,"December 31, 2011","We used to purchase instant coffee because we did not drink more than a cup a day or every other day. We thought about it a lot (we don't spend our money foolishly) and decided that it would be a safe investment to purchase a coffee maker. After doing a little research we decided on this model which has paid off greatly. It is easy to use and easy to program. It really is fool proof. The lights next to the buttons highlight your choice clearly, whether is a strong brew or a delay start. We can get it ready for the next day and wake up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee. I highly recommend it."
Elaine E. Peiffer,1.0,"February 4, 2014","We bought this coffee maker because of the thermal carafe.  There is a regular brew and a strong brew option.  The strong brew doesn't work at all.  It pretends to start and then automatically shuts off.  You have to use extra coffee grounds to make a decent cup of coffee, which I know is a personal choice, but I find it funny that this is the first coffee maker I had to add more.  It mysteriously turns on during the day even though I never set the delay brew so now I have to unplug it before I leave the house.  Please do not waste your money on this product.  The thermal carafe works great though."
Denali,5.0,"April 17, 2012","We bought this coffee maker about a week ago.  After experimenting with combinations of grinds, amount of water, and brew strength, we found a combination that makes an excellent brew.  I was disappointed that the thermal carafe from out last Mr. Coffee doesn't work in this machine, but we can simply poor the brewed coffee into that old thermal carafe after it's made.If we open the lid while pouring, the carafe that comes with this coffee maker does not drip.My wife really likes the chrome front on this machine.  It looks a lot nicer than the white or red front on the same model machine sold a WalMart."
tlb,5.0,"December 16, 2013","This coffee maker was recommended in a magazine so I looked it up on Amazon, where I buy most everything these days, and I just happened to catch it on sale.  I purchased it on Sunday and it arrived the following Wednesday, on schedule, and the packaging was very good too!  This coffee maker is replacing an older Mr. Coffee and I am really pleased with my purchase.  I like that the coffee maker has an option to brew stronger coffee with just the push of a button.  I also like being able to pour coffee before the brew is finished without making a mess. I highly recommend it!"
Deborah Gray,1.0,"May 12, 2014","I've had this for six months, and we're already buying a replacement. The pause feature doesn't work, and it isn't just a few drops that leak out (as another reviewer said), it's a significant amount that spills onto the counter. We also experienced what several other reviewers mentioned about the coffee overflowing while brewing and pooling on the counter. We've tried different brands of filters as well as a permanent filter and it still happens. We've never even brewed a full pot - we usually brew 6 cups, so this shouldn't be happening. The brew strength button seems to make no difference whatsoever. I don't recommend purchasing this."
LancenTexas,2.0,"February 11, 2018",I originally bought this coffeemaker in December 2016. It only lasted about 6 months. The Mr Coffee company replaced it for free due to warranty. No issues. Then 8 months later the the replacement quit working. When I called warranty they said they would replace it at discounted price but not for free. I said no thanks because it is a crappy product. I don't recommend this product unless you like buying a new coffeemaker every 6-8 months.
ash3s,5.0,"October 26, 2016",I'm an avid coffee drinker but lately all the coffee I drank just tasted like dirty water. Not with this coffee pot. Has to be the BEST coffee I've ever tasted. And I can make it at home!! The filter that comes with it is what I'm assuming does the trick but it may be a combination of things like water heating and such. I also bought a refill of the filters just to be sure. Had it for a few months now and coffee is still grade-a!
P. L. Seaman,5.0,"March 2, 2015","Pros: easy to use, coffee tastes great, reasonable brew time, convenientCons: unit larger than expected though not a significant problem, glass pot seems fragile but have been using a heavy percolatorHave had the unit for approximately 3 weeks. Very satisfied, especially for the price. If it only lasts > 1 year it will have been worth it. Ran water through it x3 before use, left lid open to dry after use - plastic smell dissipated within 36 hours. Coffee is hot rather than just warm.A note re: buying through Amazon: I am certainly not a flag waving Amazon fan, however, the customer service was excellent.  I ordered (and paid for) this from an Amazon vendor. After 3 weeks it had not arrived. I had received no tracking information so sent email to vendor. I received an automated reply that the vendor was no longer with Amazon.  I called Amazon customer service with an excellent result. My cc was reimbursed the amount I had paid, I ordered the item from Amazon and received it the next day which was a Sunday. An extraordinary result."
coffeedrinker,1.0,"April 7, 2015",So frustrated with this coffee maker.  Several times the coffee hasn't flowed into the pot even though the pot was sitting exactly where it is supposed to. it couldn't be pushed any farther in or out yet the coffee came out all over the pot and down under the pot and over the edge of the machine. it pretty much went everywhere except in the pot!!!  what a mess to clean up because the water going into the filter wasn't flowing fast enough so the water built up all the way to the top of the filter then overflowed everywhere. Not at all pleased.
caitie,5.0,"February 25, 2014","I use this pot every morning. It's easy to program, time and delay brew time. I found the manual very user friendly and i'm loving that it even came with a water filter. It also has the option of programming for a thermal pot, which i don't own but am considering now that i have the option. You can change the brew settings from normal to strong strength and it will even sound a beep for you when the coffee is done brewing and has a brew timer which will tell you how long the coffee has been sitting. A great feature for a big household of avid coffee drinkers."
Dwain,4.0,"December 27, 2016","This unit brews an enjoyable cup of coffee. One feature to which I suggest an improvement: The time-of-day clock is not illuminated, add that option; i.e., the ability to turn on/off back lighting of the clock. The optional stainless steel insulated carafe was also purchased. I recommend it especially if your making coffee of two different types, strengths or time of the morning drinking in your household. It is can  be a worthwhile added convenience."
Spinning Fool,3.0,"August 10, 2016","I looked up my Amazon history to see exactly when I ordered this--May 23, 2015. We have used it daily since then--about a year and two months--and today it just won't heat up. I noticed that for the past several months the three beeps that are supposed to alert you that it's done brewing would beep very early in the brewing, when it was nowhere near finished. (Our vacation rental also has this model and it did the same thing.) I like the coffeemaker but one year really is pretty disappointing. May as well buy the cheapest one if I'll need to replace it every year!"
Lamy,3.0,"January 22, 2013","Going against most of the reviews here I bought this coffee maker because it was rated high on consumer reports. I really regretted it as this coffee maker works great when you can get the reservoir to stop leaking and dripping. As most everyone reviewed you really need to fiddle to get it dripping right. Initially I thought that all the reviewers must be doing it wrong but you really do need to pay attention or else it makes a huge coffee mess (even then it may still leak). It really should not be this complicated\careful, you should just be able to fill the water add the filter coffee and be done! *sigh.."
Joan Dai,4.0,"December 11, 2013","This is a great coffee maker for a very reasonable price.  I wanted to replace a ""cheap"" coffee maker, which produced bad tasting coffee.  After some research I decided that my older maker did not heat the water sufficiently.  I don't drink coffee daily, so did not want to invest in an expensive coffee maker.  This maker has given me very good coffee from the get go.  I like that it has the extra filter.  Because I recently moved to an area with hard, nasty tasting water I use water from my Brita filter, then use the paper filter along with the built in filter.  MUCH better coffer than before!  I also like the delay brew feature.  The only thing keeping me from giving this a 5 star rating is that the clock / timer screen is too dim, and hard to read, requiring me to turn on extra light and put on glasses to set."
B. Hunt,5.0,"February 28, 2014","I love being able to set up the coffee at night and program it to make in the morning, and the coffee is good. The only thing I don't like is that except for the chrome front the rest of it is dark brown making it very difficult to see if there's any coffee in the pot - my old Mr. Coffee was white and I could see from across the room whether there was coffee but it also got brown stains around the top of the basket over the years so I guess it's a tradeoff. I definitely recommend this coffeemaker."
William J. Sutton,5.0,"November 30, 2011","I love coffee - not lattes, or cappuccino, or hazelnut - black, plain, coffee.  The first thing I noticed about this coffeemaker was the quality of the brew.  Noticeably superior to what I had been using.  I have been using Mr. Coffee products for years and expected decent quality.But I wasn't prepared for the outstanding appearance, the quality of the product, or the number of features for such a low price.  I like the choice of regular or strong brew, the fact that it beeps quietly when it's done, and the improved ability to remove the decanter while the coffee is still brewing.I live in the Philippines, so it cost me more to ship this than to buy it.  I also had to purchase a transformer to give it 110 volts.  The cost to me was a multiple of its price and it was still worth it.  I love it."
Hoyt,5.0,"September 7, 2014","I just got this coffee making a few days ago to replaceour old Bunn. The bunn had started leaking water out ofthe bottom. My wife wanted a coffee maker with a timerso I saw this model was highly rated and the price wasgood, so I ordered it from Amazon( they carry everthing).The only things I would change is where the water line islocated(on the right rear) needs to be on the front and Ihave to move the maker out on thr counter to add water and coffee,the basket needs to slide out toward the front."
KJWINSTON,4.0,"July 11, 2014","This is the second of these coffeemakers that we have purchased; the first is in a vacation home.  The timer works well and the machine brews a great cup of coffee.  Like most, the coffeemaker is plastic wherever plastic can be used; it isn't heavy and it's easy to use.  One downside - the replaceable water filter that fits in the top of the basket needs to be replaced regularly, and I often find grounds on top of it after brewing.  I normally used filtered water from the refrigerator and forget the filter."
williamm,4.0,"January 18, 2012","I was in need of a new coffee maker.  The old Black & Decker I owned had given up the ghost.  It had been recommended by Consumer Reports.  Replacement units of the B&D either leaked water or didn't work at all.  I checked with CR again and found they now recommended two models, a Cooks from JC Penney and the Mr. Coffee.  They were basically the same, so I ordered the Mr. Coffee because I liked the looks better.  It must be popular, because when I ordered it December 16, 2011, it was out of stock.  I finally got it about 3 weeks later.  I have been using it now for a couple of weeks and I am not disappointed with the maker or the coffee.  My coffee is flavorful and the maker works quickly.  On the downside, I couldn't see much difference in the ""regular"" and the ""strong"" brew strengths.  And, I really don't see much use for the water filter.  I suppose if you live somewhere and have poor water quality, it might be useful.  Otherwise, it is just something else to fool with and another way for Mr. Coffee to make money.  And, I highly recommend using the permanent gold filter, which is available as an extra.  Finally, the biggest letdown is the clock.  The display is small and dark, and you can't read it unless you get up close.  You would think that, with all of the other cute little colored lights on the unit, Mr. Coffee would have been smart enough to put a backlight in the clock.  But then, I didn't buy the Mr. Coffee unit to tell me the time.  I bought it because it was the right price and to make me a good cup of coffee.  On that, it is a success."
Frederick D,1.0,"February 14, 2017",When I first got the unit is was fantastic. Easy to use. Reliable. Six months later the lights come on but the water won't draw into the heating chamber. I've cleaned the water receptacle several times and nothing is there that I can see to block the water. Now I cannot return the unit. Six months is not very long before a quality Mr. Coffee product fails. Not very happy right now with no caffeine...
Kindle Customer,2.0,"November 27, 2016","I have had this coffee maker eight months. We stopped using the filter right away because it gave the coffee a chemical taste. It took weeks (or months, if you ask my roommate) for the plastic taste to go away.But the worst part is the electrical problems that started in the last two weeks. It would turn itself on in the middle of the night, which is when we started unplugging it when not in use. The other morning it was accidentally left plugged in, and in the middle of the day it turned itself on with lights were flashing wildly, then off, then flashing again. It has now been removed from the counter top and our old machine brought back out until a replacement is purchased.The electrical problems are well documented. Google ""Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT-AM problems"" and you'll see for yourself.Update: I contacted the Mr. Coffee people and they replaced the machine, no fuss. Great customer service. New machine is the newer model and so far, so good."
Terresa58,3.0,"April 14, 2014","After reading the reviews of this coffee pot, and looking for a pot that made really hot coffee I thought this was the answer.  I love the programmable features, but don't love the 3 beep alarm that tells me it has started.  Not sure why that's necessary.  The coffee temp is okay, but nothing to get excited about.  My husband still warms it in the microwave, straight out of the pot.  This coffee maker makes good coffee, but if you're looking for really HOT coffee, keep looking.  It's worth the money for the features, but otherwise, nothing special."
Amanda,1.0,"September 15, 2013","Great coffee pot, no real complaints except like some others have said, the ""strong brew"" feature does not work. We press it and it just reverts back to normal brew. Not a big deal for us, but could possibly be for someone who wants a stronger coffee.UPDATE on October 27th, 2014--Had this coffee pot for about a year and cannot even use it anymore. It makes every kind of coffee we brew taste disgusting, like others have mentioned. We've cleaned it as the instructions indicated, many times, and nothing helps. Will be staying away from the Mr. Coffee brand from now on."
SilverChrome,3.0,"September 27, 2015","Mine had a lifespan of around 4-months.  It stopped working a few days, the lights turn on but the unit does nothing; it won't get warm and no coffee.  It had a good price, worked efficiently when it did, the 12-cup size is great, Sure I can buy 3 or 4 for the price compare to a more expensive item.  But the idea is not to purchase a disposable coffee maker, I was looking for one that would be more reliable.  I will bemoving on to the Presto 02811 to see how that works."
Max in Valrico,5.0,"June 9, 2014","Makes good coffee fairly quickly.  I like the water filter that goes over the basket.  As well, since I like stronger brew in the morning, I like the ""stronger"" setting, I'm not sure how it does it but it does work.  The machine looks nice, seems pretty easy to clean and has different color LEDs for the various functions which are very easy to distinguish from each other.  Well worth the money and far more economical than many of the higher priced units which do exactly the same thing, make coffee."
Kathlene Smith,2.0,"May 22, 2012","We had an older progrmmable Mr. Coffee for several years.  We frequently got compliments regarding how good our coffee was.  I always gave credit to the coffee we used and the blend I would custom create rather than give credit to the coffeemaker.  Unfortunately the unit quit working.  I read many reviews before making another choice.  Since we had such good luck with the older unit, I decided to disregard the negative reviews regarding new Mr. Coffee units. They stated that the plastic in the current units gave a strange taste to the coffee and that the coffee was was not very good.  I should have given high regard to these negative reviews, as we are finding that they were accurate.  Along with the taste, comments about pouring from the caraffe are definitely accurate.  Although the coffee is drinkable, it is not up to the standard set by the older unit.  I am using the identical conditions that I used with the older unit, and I received the replacement unit within two days of the old unit, so it is not as if my memory had tempered my judgement.  And other people have also commented on my findings.  Hence, I have received authorization to return the unit to Amazon.  Their return policy is great, especially under a situation like this.  Thank you Amazon.com!"
Mr. Ed,4.0,"January 30, 2015","No smell that you wouldn't expect from any new appliance, what there was disappeared after cleaning with vinegar running two pots of clear water though it.  This unit has great features and my only grip is that the LCD display should be angled upward for easy viewing.  Unless you are one of the little people you will have to bend over to read it.  It's hard to understand how R&D could have missed that.  Come on Mr. Coffee get a cup of joe and wake up!UPDATE:  This coffee maker keeps the coffee HOT!"
L. Cole,5.0,"September 4, 2015","Works very well, fairly easy to use.  Just remember to put the special water filter on top of the grounds properly, and don't try to brew without the top piece properly on the carafe (that can cause internal overflow as auto-stop blocks coffee from flowing into the carafe).  One more criticism: the area behind the carafe should be some other color than black because black makes it hard to see how much coffee is in the carafe.  Overall it keeps my workplace coffee club quite happy."
LaineyK,2.0,"November 16, 2013","This coffee pot works fine HOWEVER what is not evident when ordering is the fact you must buy an **additional** ""water"" filter every month. When I say ""additional"" = one needs to use a coffee filter every time (plus the second filter!). (I bought the permanent filter.) I ALREADY USE FILTERED WATER and I don't want to buy a monthly water filter for this pot. The filter works as a water-spreader over the grounds so one apparently needs to use it also. TWO filters per pot?I consider the lack of Prior Notice to be a dirty trick."
P. Smith,3.0,"July 13, 2016","There's nothing like being able to stumble into the kitchen at 5am and have fresh coffee waiting for you! Excellent product!**Update**-Not long after writing my review, the hot plate started to rust over and just looks disgusting.  The glass itself is also stained, regardless of the fact that we clean it as soon as the glass has cooled.  It still works and does its job, but my fiancee hates how rusty it has become. We plan on getting a newer pot soon."
Ted,1.0,"November 21, 2015","Piece of crap! The device broke after two months so I had to go to manufacturer for warranty. Had to send in old unit and they sent me a new one which broke after 45 days! Now I have to send the old unit to them at my expense and wait 8 weeks for a refund check.I think the problem is there are too many gizmos on it. Try to buy something that is simple...the only added feature you really need is auto shut off...hard to find. I bought a Black and Decker at Target for $30,which I hope will last longer."
emily Hutchings,1.0,"December 14, 2015","We have had this coffee maker less than seven months. To our sad disappointment, after trying to make coffee this morning, the lights came on, but the water is no longer coming through the tubes to make coffee.  I guess you get what you pay for. I am now left with extra coffee filters and the reusable chrome basket."
M. Smith,3.0,"November 9, 2012","I really like it. I replaced a 3 year old Cuisinart coffee maker that I was IN love with, procrastinating and denying for months that I had to replace it. Eventually, it became difficult to turn on and it would start turning off before or immediately after brewing coffee. I searched hard for a model that was economically sound but which had decent reviews.The first complain that I have is, the top opens to the left when facing the coffee maker. This was inconvenient for me and a little difficult to get used to because where my coffee maker is located I have to turn my coffee maker each and every time to fill it up. My previous coffee maker opened towards the back and so I didn't have to move it to fill it. I wasn't about to rearrange my kitchen appliances just to suit my coffee maker, so now I have to live with this coffee maker that opens so that filling it up is awkward.Also, this coffee maker comes with a water filter that is supposed to be replaced once a month, and in comparison to my previous model, the filter is fairly inexpensive. The filter sits just over the coffee and coffee filter in the basket, so to make a pot of coffee you have to remove the filter, and to use it you have to replace it every time. It's inconvenient and slightly annoying. I understand the reasoning was to give you the option as to whether or not to use the filter, but what it does is make it more of a chore to set up the coffee maker. I would prefer an integrated filter that didn't have to be removed and replaced.The only other complaint is the inability to set the timer on the warming plate. My previous coffee maker let you program how long to keep the coffee hot, up to 4 hours after brewing. This model has a 2 hour limit, after that you have to turn the coffee maker on as though to make another batch. I understand that for most people that is fine, but I am pretty leisurely with my coffee drinking on a daily basis, and I often find myself having to turn the coffee maker back on 2-3 times before I finish the pot.The coffee maker is programmable for an automatic turn on time (set delay) and has the ability to brew normal strength or a strong strength pot of coffee. The coffee maker does not leak coffee when brewing and the carafe pours smoothly without spilling any coffee. I have seen reviews on other coffee makers of people complaining, so I thought I'd mention it ;)I really like this coffee maker. The coffee even tastes better. I went from an inner plastic carafe to a glass carafe (NO I have not tried the thermal), and the taste is just fresher...cleaner.Other than the above two specifically mentioned issues, I have no other issues with this coffee maker. I gave it three stars because despite the fact that it makes a good cup of joe, the design is such that I have to work harder for my coffee, when a coffee maker is about convenience."
Jamie Hunter,2.0,"July 17, 2016",I purchased the
MissA,5.0,"April 30, 2013","I enjoy a really good cup of coffee but didn't want to pay the exorbitant price that many have. I have used the $100 variety before and none of them lasted as well as the Mr. Coffee. This model has many improvements, a new upscale design, and is easy to use. My favorite feature is the delayed start that is optional. There is nothing like waking up in the morning and your coffee is all ready made and ready to drink! I also like the water filter (needs replacing every 1-2 months) that removes chlorine from the water you put in. Good idea!"
GS,1.0,"May 28, 2021",I would have expected to get more than 2 years out of this coffee maker before it broke.
Too buzy,4.0,"August 7, 2015","I bought this coffee pot as a replacement and so far it is doing a fine job. The only issue I have had is a bit of dripping when filling a cup mid-cycle. I normally wait until it is completely done but sometimes I am impatient and grab a 1/2 cup before it is finished. Even though it states can be done, it did drip a small amount. Not a big deal if I can wait until it is finished brewing!I do like the appearance of the of the product as it looks great on the counter."
Giradeau,3.0,"January 15, 2015","This was a replacement for same model that gave out after  several years of use. We had no problems with that model. This model produces unusual amounts of steam as it brews causing such condensation on the digital clock that it is unreadable. The front of the unit is covered in steam. Also there is so much steam/condensation that beads of water drip down the sides of the unit and water collects underneath. The solution: after coffee has brewed, immediately remove basket and wipe dry the inside of the unit and leave the top open for an hour or two until the unit has dried out inside. Problem solved and hopefully no mold or electrical problems. Hopefully."
Amazon Customer,4.0,"July 12, 2014","MAKES A GREAT CUP OF COFFEE, BUT....THE CLOCK IS NOT LIT SO IT IS BARELY VISIBLE...AND IT IS A BIT BIG AND CLUCKY...I HAVE TO PULL IT WAY OUT TO THE EDGE OF MY COUNTER IN ORDER TO OPEN THE TOP TO FILL IT...AND THE FILL LINE IS HARD TO SEE BEING IT IS ON THE BACK OF THE RIGHT SIDE, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE FRONT...AND WHO KNOW HOW LONG THAT SILVER FINISH ON THE PLASTIC WILL LAST....THE GLASS POT IS GOOD, IT DOES NOT LEAK WHEN YOU POUR FROM IT LIKE SOME OTHER POTS I HAVE HAD..."
Frank,4.0,"June 15, 2015","Good coffe maker.... Looks good and sharp, very light... It doesn't mean you will brew the coffee holding it meanwhile but hey... You can!My only 2 advise for you are:1- Brew a few times (2) before drink the coffee... If you want to know why... Try it ... Go ahead and drink one of your first two ""coladas""... Or you can call your boss to try your new awesome coffee maker and let him try it first ( start looking for another job).2- As soon as you brew the coofe remove the filter and open the cap of the machine.... If you don't do that prepare yourself for the next time you open it and see all this water falling around."
KC E.,5.0,"July 15, 2014","I know it probably seems weird to rave about a standard coffee maker... but I'm going to. It is compact, efficient, priced perfectly and I love it. My fiance loves it. Our guest love it. My favorite feature is probably the water filter (sometimes the brita is empty in the morning and I just don't want to wait for it to filter!). It is sleek looking and, again, compact. This takes up next to NO space on our counters, which is important because we are in an apartment. All in all, stop your search, this is the one :)"
The Traveller,5.0,"August 26, 2012","While we have owned coffeemaker's with more bells and whistles and ""features"" (Cuisinart, etc) this model is the best we've had, based on simplicity and ease of use. No odors. No messes. No unwanted flavors. There are beeps for the end of brewing and after 2 hours warming. You can change the brew strength. The water filter does make a difference. For us, 5 scoops into the grinder, 3 bottles of water, set the filter, push the start button...minutes later--very good hot coffee. It's really that simple, some of the 1-star reviews are really puzzling."
Happy Camper,5.0,"September 24, 2013","If you assume I am happy with this product, you'd be correct.  While being more compact (great for my limited counter top space), then other 12 cup coffee makers it still has many, if not all, of the same features as the more expensive models (do look at the model numbers when purchasing).  The one I treasure the most ""Pause and Serve"" which allows me to pour a cup of coffee in the morning before it is done brewing. Lest I sound like a commercial, I will quit there and just say it is simple to use and makes a great cup of coffee!"
jdm,3.0,"October 2, 2015","Ok, but a little disappointed.I bought this because it was listed as a good buy in the 2015 Consumer Reports and had good ratings from Amazon.  It arrived today and I tested the temp. of the water in the carafe.  It just made it to 175 degrees.  Found a review today that CR removing its recommendation because it did not reach 195-205 degrees.  Wish I had known that 3 days ago!  Will try it out for a while."
Steve,1.0,"February 6, 2015","I don't know if it is just the one we bought that is defective, but the heating element for the pitcher would not turn off.  Burning rubber smell and heat coming from the unit. Used a thermal IR gun and it went over 300 degrees before the IR gun red HI, could not register any higher.  Unplugged unit before it burst into flames.  Returning for a refund. Will not buy another one of this type.  Our previous Mr. Coffee worked for 15 year without a problem.  Sad workmanship suffers."
Paul R,2.0,"February 10, 2015","I usually make about 8 or 9 cups of coffee and use about 6 to 7 Tbsp of coffee grounds.  However, the filter basket in this pot almost always overflows and allows a large amount of grounds into the pot and from there they get into my cup.  I am very disappointed in this coffee pot.  I have tried both the normal and strong settings and it doesn't make a difference.  I have also tried both paper filters and mesh filters - again no change."
Ian Beatty,3.0,"January 9, 2014","The machine seems to work generally acceptably, though coffee made on the ""strong"" setting is still weaker than French press coffee. However, there seems to be a bug: When I try to use the ""strong"" setting with the optional thermal carafe, the machine starts brewing, and then shuts off completely after 10-15 seconds. I can turn it back on, set it back to strong, and let it start brewing again, but 10-15 seconds later it once again shuts off. The only way I've found to get a pot of ""strong"" coffee with the thermal carafe is to repeatedly do this all the way through the brew. (I didn't count how many times I had to restart it, but it's probably a couple dozen or more.) Just as a test, I tried with no coffee or filter or filter basket in place -- just plain water -- and the same thing happened.When I reported this to Mr. Coffee support & service, they very helpfully sent me a replacement and a postage-paid return label. Unfortunately, the replacement unit does exactly the same thing. It looks like a design flaw, not an isolated manufacturing defect.When I called again, tech support said they could replace my machine with a different model, but said they have no other models that can take both a glass and thermal carafe. *sigh*"
Sara McKey,2.0,"January 1, 2015","This coffee pot worked fine for about 8 months. Then the lights would go on but it would not brew. We tried everything and talked to the company and they very nicely sent us a replacement. That one worked for less than a week. The warmer plate only worked for the first few days, then the same thing happened, lights on but no brewing. Very nice customer service, they send a third one. This one is the loudest coffee pot I have ever had. It sizzles, pops, gurgles, and sounds like it is about to take off but it has been brewing and working for about 3 months now so we will see. My in-laws have the same one which does not make loud sounds though. Overall, frustrated that I did not get a consistent, quality product but at least they had good customer service. Wish this third coffee pot was quieter though."
LizMarcela,1.0,"June 11, 2015","Sad disappoint in Consumer Reports for recommended it.  Very poor quality of coffee.  As in bad.  IT takes 30% more coffee than my old pot just to brew the same strength then it taste bad.  I measured the temperature of the water in the basket and it was a paltry 170F ... way below the needed 190-205F.  The ""Extra Strength"" button is a joke... it does nothing.  Save your money. Avoid."
PB,5.0,"September 12, 2014","Having had this coffee maker for a few weeks, I can definitely rate it by what it doesn't do, compared to the Cuisinart DCC coffee maker I replaced it with, which was twice as expensive. I bought the thermal carafe to go with the coffee maker. The coffee is good and brews quickly. The coffee maker automatically senses the carafe and turns off the hot plate.- compared to the Cuisinart, this coffee maker brews quickly, even in strong brew setting- it doesn't vomit coffee all over the counter, because the thermal carafe lid can capably drain coffee into the carafe, as opposed to around it- you don't have to tip the carafe upside down just to pour yourself a cup of coffeeBrewing coffee is pretty straightfoward and the Mr. Coffee is very capable and easy to use. The coffee is good the features of the Mr. Coffee are convenient. I am not having any issues with a plastic smell as with other reviews. It's a great machine."
Fedpro,4.0,"December 7, 2011","This coffee maker is probably the best one I've owned.  It's programmable to start first thing in the morning and has a setting for stronger coffee.I've noticed a few postings where people complained that the carafe made a mess while pouring.  Well, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if you lift the cover a slight bit while pouring - NO MORE MESS.  Try it!For the price Amazon charged, this coffee maker can't be beat and it received the second highest rating in the leading consumer products magazine which was a plus for me."
QCGuy,4.0,"April 5, 2015","This is a pretty basic coffee maker but does the trick.  Its a very good value at its price point, and the reason i purchased it was the ability to add a thermal carafe for a total cost of around forty bucks.  I have not used the programming functions yet.  I went back to using a drip coffee maker from a Keurig because it makes better coffee, and is better for the environment.  Pair this up with some good ground coffee (I've been using Organic Coffee Company) and you're all set."
Steve,4.0,"February 28, 2013","This really is a good coffee maker, and a worthy successor to our much more expensive Cuisinart, which sprung a leak after several years of service.But the warming plate is not adjustable.  It keeps the coffee at about 185-195 degrees, which is fine if you live at sea level, but that's the boiling point of water if you live in Denver, so after an hour or so, the coffee starts to boil and cook, which of course makes it taste bitter.The solution is either to turn the warming plate off after a few minutes, or get the thermal carafe.  Neither is ideal."
Chrissy,1.0,"October 4, 2014","I ordered this item back in February for my cabin.  We don't live here so it has been used 50 - 60 times while we are here.  The brewed coffee has a plastic odor and taste.  I have run white vinegar through it and then several cycles of fresh rinse water.  We still cannot enjoy coffee brewed from this maker because of the plastic influence.  Also, the interrupted cycle feature does not cut off the drip completely and it drips coffeee onto the hot plate when you remove the caraffe unless it is completely done brewing.  I would never buy this product again and will have to replace not only this coffee maker but the thermal caraffe I purchased with it."
Reggie Powers,5.0,"June 22, 2011","This works as expected. Not expecting much for this price but I'm very picking and don't like crappy products. I don't expect this to have the bells and whistles of a $100 coffee machine, but who the hell needs a $100 coffee machine other than to tell people you spent $100 on a coffee machine. It makes piping hot coffee and made me realize how crappy my old one was. It looks nice in the kitchen, has the time for an unattended morning brew, and stop dripping the coffee if you pull the glass out.  This rocks for the price."

Love to shop,5.0,"October 28, 2014","I have used my coffeemaker every single day since I got it, sometimes twice, and I absolutely LOVE it! It is the best coffee maker ever! Easy to use, looks great next to my stainless steel stove. Love the filter it comes with since the flavor of my coffee comes out so much better. I have used the delayed brew a few times and it works perfectly. I would buy over again. I have already recommended it to all my coffee junkie friends and relatives."
babyboomernorcal,1.0,"June 20, 2015","I have now owned this product for 6 months, it is poorly engineered and made and I have now replaced it.First the slow drip system died, shortly after it would start on slow drip a beep would go off and then it went into regular drip. Then the regular drip slowed to a crawl, brewing 6 cups of coffee took 22 minutes, REALLY!!!!The ""shower head"" that the hot water comes out of is limited at best and does not thoroughly saturate the grounds so you have to use more coffee. The water tank is difficult to fill as it is hard to see the lines, I oftened  uses a flashlight just to see the markings.Overall, this is a poorly made and engineered product in my opinion, buy another coffee pot, anything has to be better than this one."
shareejeffers,5.0,"February 13, 2014","I ordered this coffee pot for ny husband for his birthday. He was very surprised and excited upon opening! We cleaned it by cycling water through it 4 times.

I read through the bad reviews and still lwughat the one that says "" you need the skill of a brain surgeon when filling the machine with water."" I dump the water in, put the coffee filter and coffee grounds in and let her rip. We haven't had any problems so far. We are very pleased with it and would recommend this coffee maker to others.

Michael A. Bynack,5.0,"March 9, 2015","Great coffee maker.  I use it every day and it makes great coffee.  It has the added advantage of using less grounds to make the coffee than my previous Mr Coffee, so I'm also saving money.  Another advantage was that it didn't loose the time when we had a power surge.  My old one was very sensitive to slight variations in power and would frequently loose the time and settings.  This one went through a 2 or 3 second power loss without needing to be reset."
Keegan B. Connell,3.0,"November 17, 2016","Pretty decent coffee maker, didn't last 6 months though.  To be fair it died when I took it to the cabin for a week, and I bet it would last longer sitting on your counter.

The timer function works great, the water no longer ""leaks"" out of the coffee carafe when you pour it into the machine like the older Mr. Coffee's did.  And the black color doesn't show the coffee stains if you have a slob of a husband :D.  I'm very happy with this one and hope it lasts as long as the last one did (which was probably about 20 years)."
Shopper,5.0,"January 1, 2014","I would recommend this Mr. Coffee to anyone who is looking for a coffee maker to use every day or just with company. I have a Keurig but prefer to use Mr. Coffee for company. But for 12 cups it takes about 16-20 minutes to compete. It's not a problem for me, but may be for some. So if you are planning to have coffee for company start it up 15 minutes before you are ready to serve it. TThis applies to a full pot, 12 cups. However, the hot spot does stay hot for a long time."
carolyn Sasser,5.0,"November 26, 2013","We have made a concerted effort to improve the taste of our coffee.We changed coffee several times even started using coffee beans andgrinding our own. But not that much improvement considering the work andclean up involved. Someone suggested we try a new coffee pot, ConsumerReport was checked by my husband and then Amazon.com was checked next andI am happy to report coffee much better. Even thought we had a top of the linecoffee-pot."
Dinesh Tyagi,5.0,"April 28, 2014",This has to be the best performing coffee maker that you can by for the price. The water is hot. I have not measured the temperature of the water but the ideal water temperature for best coffee is reported to be 200F and I think it is pretty much the same temperature in this unit. It is programmable so you can have the coffee ready when you wake up . You can see the water level thru the plastic window quite easily. The auto-shut takes worrying out of your mind. To be able to set the warmer temperature is a nice feature as well. I do not have the carafe option but the being able to set the warmer temperature and auto-shut make the carafe unnecessary.
theloren,5.0,"August 21, 2014","Once you read the manual, setting the timer every day is a breeze and it works perfectly.Definitely had a plastic taste for the first few weeks despite running it with just water 3 times before use. Perhaps I should've tried the vinegar rinse. However, the taste has worn off dramatically since week 3 and the benefits of waking up to brewed coffee truly outweigh that initial negative. The only problem I have with this machine is that I live in a house where people are used to unplugging ALL appliances for safety. It's been a few frustrating weeks as we all try to adapt."
dan,1.0,"February 20, 2017","I initially purchased this coffee maker with warranty through Asurion Protection Plan. The coffee kept getting cooler as time went on (purchased in January 2016) until now when you have to heat the coffee in a microwave to be hot. I attempted to use the extended warranty but Asurion has been so difficult to work with, (they want me to now register the product even though my receipt from Amazon stated """"this is your Canopy contract"" and Amazon has been no help, that I am going to just give up and buy a better brand. I think the pot was fine for about 5-6 months so if you want a short term product this is it, otherwise stay away from this coffee maker."
Jessymoka,5.0,"March 5, 2014","Our old coffee maker quit brewing. We have a Keurig we use daily, but my husband needed a coffee pot to brew morning coffee for his thermos to take to work. We are very happy with this purchase. The pot is ver handsome, it looks great sitting on our counter. It is very easy to use, and brews fresh in the morning on the timer. The beep that the coffee is done gets my husband out of bed when his alarm won't. I would absolutely purchase this pot again if given the choice."
Bamapartsman,5.0,"January 13, 2015","Listed as used with some imperfections, arrived new in opened box, never used, works perfect and was still in plastic. Incredible deal on great coffee maker for under $18!!! Made coffee twice yesterday and it works fine, brews and keeps hot coffee, the timer and all functions were easy to learn. Sure u can buy a better coffeemaker, go ahead and spend $200+ but this makes just as good of coffee as the Cusinart at my office at 1/10 the cost...Save the coins and buy better coffee!"
Lady Sunflower,2.0,"June 27, 2016","I love coffee.  We decided to move away from our Keurig back to the good ole 'normal' coffee pot.  I enjoyed this item for about 9 months.  Then it just stopped functioning.  The water doesn't filter up and the base doesn't get warm.... It all just stopped.  It doesn't even try.  I'm very disappointed that it didn't even make it a year.  No, I'm not going back to Keurig, but I have to find SOMETHING better.  It has to be out there...."
Mapster,5.0,"January 9, 2012","Bought this to replace a Cu*sinart dcc 1200 that cost double the price.  I figured that since both are probably made in china anyways, no use in paying double the price for a coffee maker.  So far so good, it does the job of brewing my coffee in the morning.  This coffee maker even has a ""brew strength"" function that the Cu*isinart does not carry.  Coffee tastes just as great.Fortunately, did not have any problems with plastic smell or taste after running a cycle of vinegar, followed by several cycles of water.I did notice the slight problem of dripping when pouring out of the carafe but figured out the technique of pouring without the spillage.Overall a great, value-for-money purchase.  Thinking of getting the thermal carafe with the money saved from opting to purchase this Mr. Coffee machine over the overpriced Cu*sinart."
patricia,5.0,"September 19, 2016","Almost bought a more expensive coffee maker but after reading the reviews in Consumers Report,  I decided to try this one as the reviews were high and it hasn't disappointed as it makes great coffee.  It comes with a few filters to take the impurities out of the water and you can adjust it you like your coffee mild or strong. The timer is easy to set and it looks more expensive than it is."
Katherine,2.0,"April 23, 2015","I thought this was going to be a good coffee pot.  However, apparently I got one that is plagued with the plastic taste that wouldn't go away even after running water through it about 15 times.  I brewed coffee through it several time and the plastic taste was still present and nothing I tried seemed to get rid of it.  If this thing didn't have plastic taste I would have given it 5 stars for performance and cost but now I'm sending it back.  I was hoping I wouldn't have the plastic taste problem like some others did."
TiMur Sales,4.0,"June 21, 2013","This makes a good cup of coffee. I use it every day, usually for 16oz of coffee. But I've also made larger pots for company. I like the brew strength selector. I did make a mess one day when I didn't realize the pot wasn't fitted properly under the filter. It caused the thing to close that allows you to pour a cup mid-brew. No coffee was going into the pot and it overflowed the filter basket. I like the charcoal filter but don't know where to find replacements. I guess I need to find them online and stock up."

Amazon Customer,4.0,"November 22, 2015","This Mr. Coffee is very easy to use and comes with a handy programmable feature so you can wake up to fresh coffee.My only complaint is that after 2 years of use, it now beeps at weird times. It is supposed to beep when it is done brewing, mine now beeps halfway through the brewing process.I recommend you purchase the Reusable Coffee Filter (sold separately) so you don't have to use paper filters!"
Helen MC,5.0,"July 19, 2015","We LOVE this!  We were so in need of a good one.  It makes really good coffee in a short time.  Easy to fill.  Love the feature that makes sure the arm is in place over the coffee grounds.  The read out is a bit small and it would be nice if that part was lit up.  Like the beep feature when it's done brewing and done heating.  Timer works well, too."
Michael,1.0,"December 12, 2018","I liked that I could program it to make coffee at a certain time so my coffee would be ready in the morning. However, there is no vent on the top of the coffee maker so all the condensation builds up on the inside cover. When you open it is dripping wet and difficult to dry all the way. If you forget to clean it out mold grows fast. Furthermore, after using it for a couple years it just stopped working. It stopped brewing mid-cycle and won't work at all now. I'm going back to a Bunn. This really pissed me off."
Chilly,2.0,"August 9, 2016","I purchased the Mr. Coffee 12-cup Programmable Coffee Maker in June, 2015.  It worked fairly well for fourteen months and quit absolutely August, 2016.  Based on reviews, I'm puzzled as to why I purchased it to begin with.  Perhaps it was the low price, but I've had cheaper that worked as well and more reliably (for many years).  At any rate, I'm shopping for another and don't recommend this one."
Rebekah E,4.0,"June 6, 2014","I bought this for my mom as a mother's day gift. I'm usually not a coffee person, but compared to others, the coffee from here actually taste pretty good. My mom enjoys the different settings and brew strengths. The only complaints I really have is that on the box and Amazon listing, it implies that it comes with the removable/reusable basket, but it does not. When we opened the box it was not inside. When we read the booklet, it said we needed to buy it separately. Misleading much? Also, the cord IS very short. Not the best things when you have cramped counter space and only 1 outlet. Overall she was happy with it tho."
Tonya,5.0,"February 2, 2014","First of all, thank you Mr. Coffee brand for making the replacement of carafes so attainable.  I have always had Mr. Coffee machines until my last one (for some reason) and was incredibly disappointed when the carafe broke and could not reasonably be replaced.  Mr. Coffee has always provided and continues to provide dependable, quality products for a more than reasonable price.  I couldn't be happier with this coffee maker and will stick with my proven favorite from now on!"
Doofenshmirtz,1.0,"December 13, 2015","Do not buy this coffee maker.  It generates a horrific burning plastic smell and taste.  I thought it would go away after several washes, but it just doesn't.  It's made from very cheap plastic.  Hamilton Beach makes a similar coffee maker for $42 and it is ten times better."
Michael Rabara,2.0,"March 27, 2018","Wow...what a piece of crap, but it did last longer than I anticipated (RIP March 2018). It beat the life expectancy of my last two coffee makers at twice and three-times the price (Breville, KitchenAid, deLonghi), so not a lot of regrets on having to “buy it again.”Don’t know how the steam got into the front digital display, so it’s messed the timer mechanism. I have to start and restart (brewing stops before it’s finished) to fill the pot.Oh, and don’t know why, but 12 cups of water only ends up being 10 cups of coffee."
"Margie in Sacramento, CA",5.0,"May 24, 2013","We've owned Mr. Coffee coffeemakers since they first came on the market DECADES ago. I hate the fact that the carafes are glass, since they want you to break them, so you need to buy replacements. When you look to buy JUST the carafe, then  you see a new maker costs just a few dollars more, so you buy a whole new coffeemaker with more bells and whistles. This unit is great, makes great hot coffee on the time we programmed it for and is much more reasonable than other coffeemakers on the market. Please note...still the glass carafe."
tbyg,5.0,"November 25, 2014","Pretty, makes good coffee, easy to use, carafe does not drip.  *NO* plastic smell/taste as some other reviewers have mentioned.This beats the heck out of our previous two coffee makers ("
TouchingPaws,1.0,"November 15, 2014","Purchased this item on 26 June after reading many reviews advertising it as the best coffemaker on the market for the money, and today, November 14,  it died.  No lights.  No power.  Full of water waiting to make a mess.  Not working.  Not returnable.  No one to contact.  It worked just four months. Very disappointed.  I will not be buying it again and cannot in good conscience suggest anyone else do so either."
CJ,5.0,"September 22, 2014",Bought this coffee maker with confidence that Consumer Reports would not recommend it unless it performed highly.  Yes we read the reviews about the taste and odor.  When we received the coffee maker we ran vinegar thru it twice and clear water.  Made coffee the next day and it had a plastic taste.  Did research on line and found that MOST coffee makers made today have that taste and odor.  We followed the advice to put the coffee maker out in the sun for a day.  We put everything including the filter in the sun.  Goodbye odor and taste.  We are now enjoying hot delicious tasting coffee.
MurphyMurphy,3.0,"April 1, 2014","I bought this to replace a ten-year-old Grind n' Brew Cuisinart, and I'm happy with my purchase.  The brew temperature is great, setting the delay is easy, and it seems hardy enough for the price.  My only compliant is that the coffeemaker automatically turns off after two hours.  I'd prefer a programmable auto-off timer so I can enjoy hot coffee over several hours without having to reheat it in the microwave.  If that's important to you, purchase a different machine."
Sleepy,5.0,"April 29, 2013","This coffee maker has all of the features that I wanted. It must have delay brew, why not wake up to a nice freshly brewed pot of coffee? It has a filter to remove the chlorine from the tap water to make the coffee taste even better. It beeps to let you know when the cycle is completed and it is beautiful; fitting in nicely with the stainless steel appliances. The only thing I would change is the time display. It is dark grey on a light grey background making it difficult to see. It was much nicer when they still had the old style bright red lighted digital numbers."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"October 9, 2015","Smelled heavily of Plastic and distorted the taste of the Gourmet Coffee that my wife and I use. I ran water through the system 6 times to get the plastic smell to subside and then perked coffee. Threw two batches away, because of the bad taste.  It was also awkward to fill with water and the steam caused by perking caused massive water dripping inside of unit. A very messy unit as a whole. I was very upset with the cheap plastic used in  construction and the Poor Engineering. A complete Redesign and better quality materials are necessary for this unit to be of any use. Then, to top everything off, I had to clean unit and repackage and ship back. I should have just thrown unit away and would have felt better about the whole ordeal.  P.S.  I put the extra purchased filters in coffee unit box. I am not into the shipping business."
KD,4.0,"November 27, 2011","I was prepared to pay as much as necessary to get a coffee maker that got great ratings, across the board.  Turns out there's no such thing; not at any price point.  So, since there was no clear winner, I decided to pick an inexpensive one.  This Mr. Coffee hasn't disappointed so far (it's only been 2 weeks).  After breaking the glass carafe on my old machine that needed replacing anyway, I thought a thermal carafe would make sense.  Those don't get great ratings either, but I liked that I could order a second, thermal carafe for this coffee maker for less than $20, just in case.  This Mr. Coffee is attractive and makes a great brew.  It's easy to set up, has a programmable timer, and comes at a very reasonable price.  It did smell a little plastic-y when brand new but that taste didn't transfer to the coffee.  I give it 4 stars because the carafe spills a little when you pour but I haven't had a maker that didn't have this issue.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.Update--6+ months of use and still really happy with this coffee maker."
Andy DeLong,2.0,"September 13, 2015","We've had this coffee maker for about a month now, I believe, and we have had a whale of a time with grounds in the pot. We've peeked around online at suggestions and through the manual for anything we may have missed, including shaking out the grounds to level out the basket, wetting the filter, and extensively staring at the valve in an attempt to magically fix it. My concern, and the reason I've returned to Amazon to review, is that the permanent, sold-separately filter will be the fix, and I find that remarkably frustrating.We've had no other problems with the coffee, and they've dressed up the now-standard digital features same as any other manufacturer. Those grounds, and the subsequent grounds in the teeth, are a disappointment."
Dylan Busjahn,5.0,"November 19, 2014","Shiny.  Bought as a gift for my Fiance, and this one was well reviewed. I didn't see the reviews of malodorous brewing until after we had opened it and set to taste the magic. The plastic smell was mild, but the taste was excruciating for the first pot. I re-cleaned everything removable and ran several pots of plain water through, and the taste is gone. The included glass carafe pours smoothly and without dripping. The temperature is good, just a trifle to hot to drink poured right after brewing is done (I am always standing at the pot waiting for the goodness as it finishes) and after it has sat a few minutes it's good to go right out of the pot. The 'Brew finished' beeping is loud enough to easily hear if you're paying attention, and quiet enough to miss if you're not.  Barring any adverse changes in the near future, I'm rating it a keeper."
rituali,1.0,"February 26, 2016",Unfortunately the coffee machine failed right out of the box. The carafe doesn't meet the plunger. In running the first pot of coffee I had to hold the carafe off the plate in order to activated the drip from the coffee filter so it stopped overflowing from the top. Happily I used water for the first try and only had to clean up water. So disappointed
GordonSt,3.0,"January 7, 2014","I ordered this as it was recommended by Consumers Report. I usually brew a half pot and like to use the brew strength function to make the coffee stronger. I noticed that the brew strength light would go out after a few seconds and the coffee maker would beep...well before the coffee had brewed. Seems like an electronic misfire, so I returned it. Other users have noted this issue on here. Perhaps Mr. Coffee might correct this in the future. Otherwise, it's priced reasonably and not as tall as most other coffee makers."
kruisinet,3.0,"May 29, 2015","This coffee maker works as advertised, but does not make a consistently good cup of coffee.  From the outset, coffee had the taste of plastic leeching into it.  Tried everything to get rid of it:  running vinegar through it several times, setting it outside in the sun, leaving it outside overnight, washing it thoroughly.  Still don't get a consistently good-tasting cup of coffee.  Attractive unit, but the most important aspect is lacking."
EB-CB,1.0,"February 13, 2014","Owned many Mr. Coffee coffeemakers and have never had a problem until this model.  Great for first month and then performance kept getting worse.  Had to unplug today as it was so hot I thought it was going to start a fire.  The coffee has brewed slower every day since we owned.  Just a bad product with very poor performance.  Time to buy something else to replace it.  Hesitant to buy another Mr. Coffee, but as noted above, we have never had a problem with one before this unit."
Jeffrey G. Smith,4.0,"April 22, 2015","UPDATE - Mr. Coffee is sending us a new unit to replace the failed experiment that was the first one. Credit to them, right? I'm updating my rating from 1 to 4. I'll keep you posted if there are changes.-----Unfortunately, this coffee maker has begun malfunctioning. The digital indicator is fogged up and it began beeping non-stop this morning to indicate the brew was done. Something has gone wrong with it and we purchased it brand new less than three months ago."
Lawbrown,5.0,"October 9, 2013","I was skeptical about Mr. Coffee.  I have used mostly Cuisinart products in the past.  I have had this for about a month and use it once or twice each day.PROS:This pot pours easily with out spills or drips.The profile of the machine is low enough to fit under the cabinets above the counter.The water level is easy to see when filling the tank, no accidental over filling.The autobrew function works with no problems.The burner plate shuts off before the coffee burns.  (Only used once.  Usually the pot is empty before it times out.)Easy to use.CONS:Kind of dorky filter that sits over the coffee grounds when brewing.  It works fine, but it is different.I am very happy with this coffee maker and would buy another one.  I really hope it lasts for a while."
PP,5.0,"December 27, 2012","I've had this coffee maker for about a month and I love every feature about it.  For the price, I don't think it can be beat. For those who have listed that it is hard to pour water in it in the back and for the beeping that it makes when the coffee is ready, I just don't get either complaint. There is  plenty of room to pour the water in, and the beeping is very faint at best.  I did make sure to run mine with 3 brews of water and one with vinegar and I didn't experience any plastic type smells."
Hugbell,5.0,"August 31, 2016","Mr. Coffee has never let me and my family down. Our old coffeemaker started staying on constantly it was at least a good five years old, we only discovered it by accident when I smelled something hot. This is one of the better designs as the door where you place the water on top is set into the coffee maker itself! Which means no more water on the cabinet from sweating coffee makers!"
Samantha Peak-Rowe,4.0,"November 24, 2015",I bought this when my old one broke I needed a new one at a good price. I've had the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker for over a year and it's still working great. The only downfall is having to buy the replacement filters. If you don't use them the coffee tastes really funky. If you want something fancy this isn't the machine for you.
Caroline,1.0,"September 20, 2013","This coffee maker was recommended in  the reviews - it also had some negative reviews which I ignored, unfortunately.  The coffee still has a lingering taste of plastic, after numerous usages.  It also doesn't taste like coffee - it just doesn't taste like much of anything, despite using more and more coffee when I make it. I hate to return it but my husband complains about the bad coffee he is getting. What to do?"
Becky Reed,1.0,"May 5, 2016",I  bought this product in Jan. 2016. It already does not work. The heating element has gone in it and will not brew. I am very disappointed in this product. I thought with it costing more and having good reviews that it would be a good investment. Boy was I wrong! This compares to the really cheap products that only last a few months. VERY DISAPPOINTED.
Duffer.,5.0,"August 4, 2014","I switched to K and Vue cups because of the convenience they provide. I got rid of my coffee grind & brewer, my stand alone grinder and my non-grinder coffee maker. My Vue cup died fairly young so I had to return it to BJ's. Having use of only a K-Cup brewer I have purchased every brand, every roast and every boldness that I can find. All  of them seem to taste about the same to me. When I purchased a Hawaiian Blend that had only 2% Hawaiian in it that was a signal that action was required and I decided to give my taste buds an occasional break and bought this Mr. Coffee.This coffee maker was easy to set up, looks good on my kitchen counter and is a cinch to use. I bought a bag of 100% grown and roasted in the USA Hawaiian ground coffee and brewed up a mug. What I got was REAL coffee. The Mr. Coffee has a ""Strong"" button which I pushed and brewed another cup. What a difference between Mr. Coffee and Mr. Keurig when it comes to making a satisfying cup of coffee.Ok, here is the bottom line. The K-Cup method is very fast, leaves no mess and is so simple to use that the convenience trumps the taste factor IMHO. Mr. Coffee brews coffee of far superior taste than any K-Cup. But, it does require buying filters and bags of coffee that need to be measured, takes longer to brew and requires clean up of equipment. My personal solution to this dilemma is that I will be a K-Cup user the majority of the time but when the urge for taste becomes overwhelming, which I project to happen about three or four times a month, I will ease over to where Mr. Coffee is parked and take advantage of his outstanding ability to produce an excellent cup of coffee. After I win the lottery and can hire a maid to make my coffee I will switch to Mr. Coffee exclusively."
A. H. Clay,4.0,"March 19, 2014","I bought this only because Consumer Reports loved it. So I didn't read the description particularly carefully. Wonderfully surprised! You can choose regular or strong brew, set it to brew at a later time (and it's easy), and you can order a separate thermal carafe. That comes in handy if you have a crowd that wants both decaf and regular. Just brew the first round in the thermal and then use the glass one for the other. Very attractive on the counter!"
mellagirl,3.0,"November 11, 2015",I received  this as a gift. Initially i found it not to be very user  friendly  and maintanence  is a bit of work. The coffee has  a weird machine like after taste unless you add a lot of cremer and have a very flavorful coffee. Overall its decent. Its probably  best suited  in an office setting or for huge coffee drinkers since it takes a lot of measuring and somtimes trial and error  to get a cup or two only  for light coffee drinkers like myself.
cureeousg,2.0,"February 20, 2013","We're big coffee drinkers...and love STRONG coffee.  We've used this for a month and can't get it to 1) be consistent 2) be flavorful or strong...EVEN after using the ""strong"" setting and using Italian roast or french roast (it's all we drink).We went from a Krups cone filter maker to this one, which has a flat basket and I think that makes all the difference. So, in order to get the coffee strong enough, we have to use 1.5 times the coffee we'd normally use.  So, not only did we pay 40 or so bucks for this, now we blow through coffee left and right, costing us more.Coffee snobs beware:  If you like your coffee strong, this one isn't for you.  Get one with a cone filter."
Jim M from Oregon,5.0,"February 17, 2014","After reading reviews I bought this to replace my other HB model which started to leak and stop in the middle of the brew after only 1 month beyond the 90 day return. I'm able to return the HB but needed one in the interim. The price on Amazon was excellent and I knew if anything happened to it, returning it would not be a problem. The brewing is fast and the coffee is great as I made an average of 3 to 4 pots a day. For the price you can't beat it."
david reed,4.0,"January 14, 2014","Bunn makes a far better system than this one. The consumer reporting on Bunn's has ALWAYS been negative. So why do most restaurants and chefs use Bunn?

Donald M.,5.0,"June 25, 2014","I like a strong cup of coffee, so I'm used to putting in a lot of coffee grounds.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  Too many coffee grounds slowed down the drip, so as a result, the coffee backed up and ran all over the coffee maker and the counter.  After cleaning up, I figured out the problem and put fewer grounds in.  What a yummy pot of coffee  So now actually I can have a strong cup of coffee and use LESS grounds.  I'm actually saving!!"
Susan Grace,4.0,"March 27, 2014",We had an expensive Cuisinart which only lasted one year. This one was not only cheaper but makes a better cup of coffee. We also have a Keurig but only use that for special occasions or when we want an extra cup later in the day or a cup of flavored coffee. This one is easy to program and we can wake up to a full pot of fresh brewed coffee. I only gave it 4 stars because we only had it 2 months and I want to see if it lasts longer than the Cuisinart.
Kathie Bach,1.0,"February 22, 2016","I gave this coffee maker to my parents and it broke within 3 weeks. I went online to review if others had had the same problem and there were many negative comments about this machine.  When I went to return the item through Amazon, I was told it was no longer eligible for return or refund. Huge mistake. Do NOT purchase this machine. Check online reviews first. I also have to say this is the first bad experience I've had with Amazon and with a return. I usually love the products and appreciate my ability to return defective merchandise. Bad experience this time, sadly."
Jeff Herter,5.0,"December 28, 2012","You can't beat the price to performance/quality ratio on this.  I read some people had problems with it leaking.  I have no such trouble.  The unit is very well designed and vastly outperforms my previous coffee maker at the same price level.  The carafe is well balanced when full and doesn't dribble down the side as so many of them do (when full of coffee).  I love it.  Seems to brew a lot hotter than my previous unit as well giving the coffee a fuller, more robust flavor."
Kel Michaels Mantell,2.0,"May 7, 2013","AMAZON!  I received this unit used. Not correctly packaged as new, coffee stuck to top of carafe, spots on carafe and fake chrome of unit....I figured no big deal; it also had a strong smell of chlorine. I cleaned it up; thinking someone just didn't like it for whatever reason. Not so! I ran two pots thru to get the smell out and clean it; both pots: stopped at 8 cups and beeped. Water stayed in the top! I am amazed since I had the same issue with a more expensive Cuisinart!  Is it ME?!  Nope, I read instructions first even tho it isn't necessarily rocket science to run a coffee pot!  I asked for a replacement and I am HOPING it is relatively new and just plain WORKS!  Will update this unit when I get the 'next' one. The chrome is very plastic; no big deal for the price...I like the size of the unit and the buttons, etc; it just doesn't WORK!!!Update:Amazon made good and sent me out a new unit the next day! Cons: only stays on a while; had another pot that stayed on from 2-4 hours. Since I get up way before my husband; have to keep turning it off and on to stay on...you have to make sure that you put in over 12 cups in the machine to actually get 12 cups. Doesn't make a very hot cup of coffee.Overall, I won't use this for very long since I am used to a brewstation with so many more features."
Carissa88,4.0,"January 26, 2015","This coffee maker was exactly what I expected. The only ""bad"" thing is the clock doesn't light up. It's nice to have a clock you can see in the dark but not necessary for me since I have both a microwave and oven that have lighted digital clocks. The new plastic smell that occurs while brewing is only that, a smell. I don't taste it in my coffee at all. The temperature is hotter than all of my previous coffee makers though I don't have a thermometer to check the actual temp. This product is true to it's description."
Amy Conyers,5.0,"December 29, 2016","I am very glad I chose this Coffeemaker! I like that it has a filter so I can use tap water if I wanted, it has a timer so it shuts itself off after so long, makes a sound when the coffee is done brewing and when it's turned itself off, is easy to use and easy to clean."
Angela Rick,5.0,"May 11, 2014","My old coffee machine broke after 4 years of heavy use. I was looking for a mid priced programmable coffee machine and found this. It's nice looking, fits in with my kitchen (mix of stainless and black) decor and works wonderfully! Comes with a glass carafe but you can buy a thermal one if you prefer those. The machine detects which carafe you're using and operates accordingly. Really do love this coffee machine, best purchase I've made!"
Michael,1.0,"November 28, 2015","Bought this coffee pot, after owning one like it for two or three years. After a little over 4 months, when I turned it on this morning for a much needed  cup of coffee, it started brewing, leaving about a quarter inch of coffee in the bottom of the pot. Then it stopped brewing. Tried turning off and back on, and it turns on, but does not brew! I just wish it would have worked as well as the previous one I owned!"
G25,1.0,"July 6, 2015","Reports of terrible plastic taste are NOT exaggerated.I had a Cuisinart that worked great for many years, but when I finally needed to replace it, I found that reviewers said new models don't measure up. So I ordered this Mr. Coffee instead, figuring it's a vat of boiling water that drips through grounds, how hard can it be? I am using the same coffee and water that I used in my previous brewer, and the result is just awful. Seriously, I would much rather drink instant or vending machine coffee.I wish I had returned it within the 30 day period. I kept waiting for the plastic taste to go away, but I actually think it might be getting worse.Do yourself a favor and keep looking."
C. Doughty,4.0,"November 2, 2016","This is a replacement unit. I've used a similar product, same brand, for years which finally failed. I'm almost perfectly happy with it with one exception, I have to indicate I want strong coffee each time I brew some, and this machine doesn't appear to hold that selection, I have to make that selection every time I brew a pot."
tusimay,5.0,"April 25, 2012","I love this coffee maker!  I love the water filter.  It really makes the coffee taste better!  I like the other features like the delay brew and the way it turns itself off after two hours.  The coffee seams to stay fresh longer, too.  I also like being able to choose between the thermal and glass carafe.  You can also pick regular or strong brew.  Coffee is really hot.  I have been using mine for a week now and I absolutely love it!  I am very, very picky, too about my coffee.  Great price!"
Steven Buchanan,1.0,"July 2, 2017",This one quit working just a few months after I got it.It is Chinese made and must be out of poor electronics.I bought a Zojirushi and it works great so far.  It is also Chinese made but the Japanese designed it and must be working with manufacturers to make sure quality is high.
Corey Wade,1.0,"January 7, 2016","We have been satisfied with the coffee maker for 4 months. Today it stopped working. Go to the Mr Coffee website and find my symptoms, the site says to request a replacement. Four months of decent coffee, but i expected to get more than four months out of it before having to trash it."
Motown Jane,2.0,"November 16, 2013","The machine simply would not work with the thermal carafe. It shut itself off after a few seconds every time. I tried everything recommended on the website and in the manual to make sure I was positioning everything correctly. Nothing helped. It worked with the glass carafe, though the coffee was to my tastes a little weak even though i used the strong setting. However, since I bought this one to use with the thermal carafe, it has to go back."
Martin,5.0,"April 27, 2020",We like to set it at night and wake up to a fresh pot of coffee.
G. Smith,5.0,"May 17, 2015","Excellent price and shipping. Simple w/o all the bells and whistles. Great tasting coffee. Also combined with the: Mr. Coffee GTF2-1 Basket-Style Gold Tone Permanent Filter, and the Mr. Coffee DRD95 8-Cup Stainless Steel Double-Walled Thermal Carafe Accessory. I make a larg pot or 2 at one time and put in the frige. Zap a cup in microwave  and tastes fresh"
Joe Trent,3.0,"April 26, 2013","The water filter is in a terrible position in my opinion.  The fact that I have to take out and set the filter off to the side every time I want to make coffee is an annoyance.  I don't want to mess with moving the filter early in the morning.  I mean really, my eyes are barely open and I am not ""assembling"" anything at that hour.  Sure I can make it at night - and in the grand scheme - it isn't that big of a deal. (Only reason so far this not a 4/5 star machine).  - Almost forgot - the filter is ""supposed"" to be changed every 30 days - which means more ""stuff"" to buy in addition to coffee.All that being said - this coffee maker has the right price - and though it isn't my favorite because of the filter - I have coffee in the morning.  I can't really ask for much more than that.  Would I recommend this - YES.  Though, had I realized how the filter was setup prior to ordering, it is likely I would have gone for a different model."
Y. Y. Chang,3.0,"September 6, 2015","We have been using this for 3 years now. A while ago I have been smelling some smoke thought maybe it came from the next door. Later I found out it came from the coffee inside the pot.Not sure how the coffee smells so burnt that smells like cigarette smoke, which I am allergic to.It works perfect still but I guess I am gonna try a different way to brew coffee."
Kehly,3.0,"July 5, 2018","Worked well for a few years but then started leaking awfully. It leaked water from the reservoir so I couldn't ever use the delay brew, as I'd have a full pot of water on my counter and hardwood for before morning."
A CHOOSY ROSE,5.0,"March 27, 2014","We have bought so many different coffee pots at substantially higher prices than this and invariably, the water is difficult to pour or the pot leaks when filling the coffee cups, but not so here.  This is easy to use, fill, pour and has setting for regular or extra strong.  This makes a great, strong cup of coffee.  Note, it doesn't have a washable filter, so prepare to buy filters, or order a replacement filter if you need one."
webeshe,4.0,"February 4, 2013","This is a great coffee maker with extra features not expected in one at this price!  Due to its water filter, the coffee is very smooth. It lets you know when coffee is ready and before it shuts off.  You can choose regular brew or strong.  I purchased the additional thermal carafe and reusable filter basket and this machine was still less than a comparable one at Walmart!  The only thing I wish it had is a lighted clock. It has a clock but it is sometimes hard to read.  Otherwise, I am very pleased with my purchase!"
WSBooth,4.0,"October 24, 2015",Looks more expensive then the price- arrived when promised and was packaged within the a way that no damage could occur to the product.  The product meets that expectations of this user and more.  It's easy to operate and gives you options that many coffee maker products do NOT have.  I enjoy the coffeemaker very much and am pleased to say that I am a fan of this product.
Josh Hagen,5.0,"January 9, 2013","I was weary to buy this because of the reviews concerning smell and taste. As soon as I plugged it in I followed the first time use instructions provided with this unit and have had no issues whatsoever. This produces clean, hot, and quick coffee. I could not be any happier with a coffee machine unless it did my taxes as well. It even has a built in water filter that is easily removed. Use it when you want. The water filter does slow down the brewing a bit though."
Gypsy Chris,4.0,"January 18, 2014",Keeps the coffee nice and hot and was great value for money.  My only complaint is that we bought this unit based on the Consumers Report rating and we are from Canada and had to buy from Amazon US as this model was not available from Canada except at 6X the price.  We therefore had high shipping costs.  Turns out the same model is available in Canada under the Sunbeam name and had we known this we would have saved about 50% of the cost.
Michelle Lintvedt,3.0,"August 20, 2013","I called Mr. Coffee company and graciously replaced the first one without having to return the one that didn't work right.  Unfortunately the second one wouldn't work on the ""strong"" setting either.  When I called the company again (I don't know if they thought I was trying to get another free coffee maker out of the deal or what.  I offered to send it back) they said that they noticed this was my second one and that it really was working it was just a glitch in that model.  I know how it's supposed to work as my daughter has one of these.  The strong setting takes longer to brew.  This one would beep and shut the strong setting off.  Makes good coffee otherwise."
Joan,1.0,"April 22, 2019",I really did like this coffee maker. My last one worked very nicely for many years.  Unfortunately the lights go on but nothing happens. Must be a short in this one.  Too late to return.
onlineshopper3,5.0,"July 30, 2016","I have always had a Mr Coffee coffee maker. This one is the best! I can finally make 10 cups at once, Program it for delay brew and it looks great too! I love that the cord can be wrap up in the compartment in the back, leaving more counter space. Everything is easy to program. The only thing I wish it did have is the clock to light up to see it better."
Susan Cohen,1.0,"February 14, 2014","I am disappointed in this Mr. Coffee.  I did my research and this machine did get a good write up.  I find that there is a plastic smell in the machine.  Every time I lift the lid I smell it.  The coffee is just OK and does not have that smell.  It is large and cumbersome.  I also find that it is incovenient to pour the water into the recepticle.  The area in the back, where you pour the water is very small.  I would not purchase again."
Zebulbrox,2.0,"November 27, 2016","After renovations of my kitchen, I wanted a coffee pot that worked in the new space.  This coffee pot was purchased on 7/2015, by 11/2015 it stopped heating up. I replaced it with an identical make/model. Now 1 year later, it has failed. It stopped heating up. I've contacted Mr. Coffee directly with no response. For the purchase price of $34.92, it is not worth your time. I will say when it worked, it was great, but it will not last one full year."
Pamela Schubert,4.0,"October 29, 2012","The main reason I needed a new coffee maker was to replace an older Mr. Coffee that spilled more water on the counter than in the water fill area.  At first I thought my husband wasn't fully awake when pouring the water into the coffeemaker, but it happened no matter who made coffee or how carefully we poured the water.  This coffeemaker and carafe seem to be better designed so that all the water pours into the fill area.I had seen complaints about the strong plastic smell/taste, but we haven't had any problems.  I did hand wash all the plastic components and ran a carafe of water through the machine before we brewed our first pot of coffee.  Perhaps that prevented the problem.I would definitely buy this model again--and will give it as a gift in the future."
Marie,5.0,"August 3, 2013",LOVE this coffee maker. Read a review in Consumer Reports rating it second best and it is worthy of its high rating. This gem has a water filter disk that fits over the coffee basket. The coffee is brewed pipping hot & pretty quickly. This machine doesn't take up too much space on my counter top AND it looks great!  The super cool thing is that you can use a glass carafe OR a thermal carafe (Amazon sells them for only $16). Very pleased with this purchase.
Debra,3.0,"August 17, 2015","Because of the filter issue that I am experiencing, I am not certain if I like this coffee maker or not. The filters are thin and during the brewing process, the filter folds over, which adds grinds into the coffee. Not good!!I am hoping by using 2 filters at the same time will alleviate this problem. Time will tell."
Kindle Customer,1.0,"December 18, 2015","THis is the second Mr Coffee of this model. The first overflowed the basket because the water was forced through faster that it should have. It was returned under the thirty-day period. Now the second, after five months of daily use, is failing to make coffee at all. Since it is out of the 30-day return policy I will simply trash it and get some other brand of coffee maker. Strong suggestion--do not buy."
sammy,1.0,"August 28, 2017","Quit working entirely after just over a year. I think the heating element stopped working. Basically, when turned on, the water will not siphon through and there is just a small clicking sound which is probably the heating element attempting to turn on. Coffee makers should last for decades; not just one year."
Robert Therina,5.0,"February 26, 2015",The coffee maker works great and I like that I can program it so it's ready in the morning. I also like that it shuts off after 2 hours so I don't leave it on while I'm gone all day. I had to open it up and yank out the annoying beeping speaker though. It made one of my dogs bark every morning and would wake up my granddaughter when she was over. It would be nice if there was a button to disable it.
Mama Mary,5.0,"March 20, 2015","I purchased this (I might add that with Prime, at less than half ($26) of the current price showing here - do your research) as a backup to my Keurig, which I love. In the mornings I was finding myself drinking 3 or more cups of coffee though here lately and it just didn't make economical sense to plow through that many K-cups every morning. They are not cheap! I've had Mr. Coffee machines before so that's why I chose this brand - it's reliable and not over-priced. It took a little to get used to not having instantaneous coffee, but it's really not that long of a wait, although after the Keurig, it seems like it that first pot! I'm retired, so won't have much use for the auto brew feature, but it's nice that it's there if I ever need to get up at a set time to have coffee at the ready. I really like the beeping feature that both lets you know the coffee is ready and also when the unit automatically shuts off, so that if you're not quite finished with your pot, you can turn it back on. I'm so glad that I didn't listen to negative reviews about plastic smells and/or taste, or even leaking, because I haven't found any one of those complaints to be at all valid! Read the manual, follow the directions, wash everything, run a pot of water through, don't overfill the carafe, or spill when you pour the water in, and you'll have a great coffee pot with great tasting coffee at just the right temperature. It works great & does what it's supposed to! Very happy with this purchase."
Bernie Ackerman,5.0,"July 1, 2013","There is nothing not to like about this Mr Coffee model.  I got rid of my BD machine after only two months because of very loud operation and the short spout of the caraf created a mess no matter how careful I was.I bought this machine at Amazon, and it has been a dream.  It looks classy, quiet operation,pours without a mess, many options, and best of all, it makes great coffee.  No wonder it was voted best product of the year."
B. McLaughlin,2.0,"June 26, 2016","This coffee pot has been dysfunctional from the first week I bought it. I thought it was user error because I was so used to making coffee with a Keurig. However, each time the coffee would not brew correctly, I retraced my steps, and did exactly what I was supposed to do.For example, I will put the coffee grounds and water in, press start, then walk away. I here the beep and return, and find there is no coffee in the POT! I open the top and see “coffee water” floating in the filter. This has happened 4 times now. I am getting very frustrated because I am WASTING coffee!! Not to mention, it makes me late for work when I have to re-brew a pot of coffee."
Ms. M.,5.0,"October 26, 2014","I love this coffee maker!  It works perfectly. If you're like me, you've read all the reviews and are carefully considering your purchase. Rest assured, I think any of the problems noted are either anomalies or due to misuse. Mr. Coffee has been around for ages because it is easy to use, dependable, and includes the features you want in your coffeemaker. Buy and enjoy!  P.S. I love working with Amazon!  They have never disappointed me."
J Murdock,5.0,"September 4, 2015","Purchased after our 3 kuerig this year stopped working. we asked kuerig not to bother sending a replacement and instead went back to ""pot"" vs. pod coffee. Could not be happier. This model received high reviews on several consumer and coffee websites, so we gave it go and and are so happy we did. I love the pause and serve feature for the mornings I just can't wait the 8 mins for 12 cups to brew but mostly it just works and the coffee tastes good out of it. We will never go back to pod coffee again. When I really just want one cup, I'll use the Chemex or the french press. Plus this machine doesn't hog counter space and is relatively compact."
H. Shannon,2.0,"January 29, 2014","I purchased this coffee maker in January 2012 to replace a Cuisinart that dies after 18 months of use. The last few days, I've noticed that the coffee comes out like water. It isn't brewing properly because the heating unit is shot. We use this pot everyday and I even bought Mr. Coffee filters for it and changed them regularly because I figured if I was a responsible coffee maker owner, it would last. I was wrong. It lasted only 24 months. One star for each year it worked. pbbbthhhIn the Cuisinart review I said I was going to buy a Krups because I've owned one before and it served me faithfully. It's my fault for diverting from this idea. I'm buying one right after I'm done with this review."
MB0,3.0,"September 16, 2013","First of all, none of the coffee makers last anymore.  My original Mr. Coffee lasted for over 20 years.  We've been through at least 5 or 6 in the last 15, since then.  The last several weren't Mr. Coffee's on purpose; because the decanter spills water all over when trying to fill the tank.  From purchasing this one, I can see they still haven't corrected the problem.  Feature-wise, it's a very nice unit, however."
nvoss,5.0,"February 20, 2021",Great flavor
Robert S. Gurwin,4.0,"December 1, 2013","Great coffee maker for the price.  It is easy to fill since the reservoir tank has a large opening, and contrary to some of the other reviews that I have read, I have never had an issue with coffee spilling or dripping when I pour from the carafe.  I agree with the comment that others have posted about the smell and taste of plastic.  My unit is now about a month old and that is finally wearing off from daily use but unlike some of the pricer models, the housing and reservoir tank are all plastic and that comes through.  Overall, a very good unit and glad to have purchased it to replace my prior Cuisinart brand coffee maker that was a fire hazard."
Firas K,5.0,"November 13, 2014","Quality is great and one of the most things l like about it is it's easy to clean especially when it becomes a daily habit. Between cleaning, reloading and replacing, it takes me only five minutes. The only feature l wished was there is to have the option to keep the coffee warm until manually turning it off in addition to the already included feature which is the automatic 2-hour shut off. I strongly recommend this coffee maker."
N. Dudley,1.0,"April 5, 2016",This coffee maker worked great for three months and then it stopped working.  It was only returnable for 30 days so now we are stuck with a dud. I'll buy my next one locally and I'll pay a little more but at least I'll have someone to talk to if it stops working after 30 days.
Mitch,1.0,"July 6, 2016","I purchased this coffee maker less than 2 months ago - and today it decided to stop working.  I've had many Mr. Coffee coffeemakers - and despite some of the other reviews that I read on this site -  I decided to give it a try - based on history.  However - that was a mistake.  In the short time we have had it - it has overflowed once and now the water pump isn't working at all.  Instead of a full pot - we had only 6 cups this morning - and regardless of our efforts that was it.  This is nothing more than garbage.  Might as well have thrown the money away,."
DeluXXXe,4.0,"June 28, 2013","I like the look of the unit, makes decent cup of coffee. I like that you can set it up for delay brewing the night before.The little circular water filter it uses is kind of redundant (I use Brita filtered water)I hate how when you lift the lid to remove the coffee filter theres water on the top inside of the lid that collects during brewing and kind of spills on the counter. Otherwise good little coffee maker"
Brandon DeWitt,1.0,"March 26, 2016","I originally ordered one of these in January and it ended up being a problem right out of the box. Just wouldn't brew, period. Amazon was nice enough to replace it with the same model and we've been using it for a couple of months. While it has worked, it has been a good coffee maker, but just this morning, after two months, it won't brew either. Now, I can't return it to Amazon, because I'm outside of their time frame. The manufacturer offers a year warranty, but we all know how they play that game. I would not recommend anyone buying this as I've now had two duds in two months."
Anne L,5.0,"November 24, 2014","This coffeemaker is great and makes a delicious cup of coffee!  I like that an alarm sounds when the timer is ready to shut off the coffeemaker.  The filters are available at our local Wal-Mart, and I appreciate the fact that using a filter makes a better cup of coffee.  Also, the carafe is dripless which I haven't always found the case with a coffeemaker.;  Now I'd better not break this one!"
Sebastian Morgan,5.0,"July 28, 2016","Six months in, and still no complaints. Drip arrestor works well, buttons are functional. Not sure what the chlorine filter does - I can't notice the taste difference, but maybe that's because I drink my coffee black. If you like strong coffee, you'll want to use the 'strong' brew mode. I even used undersized filters for a couple of days while moving in to a new place, and grounds that washed into the arrestor were easily purged with tap water afterwards. Simple, functional, and easy to maintain."
Jake,4.0,"April 13, 2015","Pros:-when you close the lid it knocks the water arm into place-beeps when done! this is so cool!!-big opening to dump water in, making less mess when trying to wake up and get my coffee-aesthetically appealingCons:-bulky, can't slide it around on counter easily (this might be a bonus for some people)-lots of buttons I won't ever useConclusion:I like it!  Great deal."
Jason K.,5.0,"February 4, 2014","We have a Keurig, which is very convenient but not if you need to brew a pot for a larger group.  This Mr. Coffee is easy to use and program.  The plastic ""aluminum/black"" color combination looks good with our stainless steel appliances and the pot is easy to clean.  I have not tried the insulated carafe that is available but may look into that in the future to keep coffee warm without using the warmer of the coffeemaker itself."
PatD,5.0,"October 8, 2013","This was a gift but I have one exactly like it. I live alone, set it up with water the night before. Instead of ground coffee I just have the hot water which I use for instant coffee, or tea, or even cocoa. Whatever I'm in the mood for. And, because I'm sorta up in years it's nice to know it will shut itself off in a couple of hours in case I forget. If it ever breaks down I'll get another just like it."
Patricia P. Surrey,5.0,"October 1, 2012","I am quite happy with this pot.  It is easy to set the timer and easy to set up the coffee.  The coffee comes out delicious.  There is a filter included but we don't need it.  NY water tends to be pretty pure.  But if you want surgical suite level purity, the filter is cool.  It has a mechanism that tells you when the filter needs changing.  Not sure if that works, like I said.It is also pretty quiet while brewing.  I reccomend it."
Randy,4.0,"February 5, 2014","This coffee maker was rated as a best buy from consumer reports, so I decided to give it a try. Works very nice, has all the features I wanted, timer, sneak-a-cup, brew strength adjustment. Not as fast as I'd hoped, but not as slow as my old one was. My only negative is the design of the Mr. Coffee glass carafes, which make it impossible to pour a full 12 cups of water into the coffee maker without the water running down the carafe  and onto the counter. The wife doesn't appreciate that."
Sarah Gleich Lynn,3.0,"January 20, 2014","As many of the reviews have noted, this is a great inexpensive coffee maker for daily use.  It only gets three stars though because the water guage is positioned in such a way that every morning you have to pull the coffee maker all the way out from the wall and rotate it around to make sure you are putting the right amount of water in.  Maybe not an issue if you put this somewhere without overhead cabinets, but for us it is a bit of a pain."
Houtzwife,1.0,"March 24, 2015","This machine quit working after 6 weeks of use.  Just stopped brewing completely.  I had purchased a second one as a gift for a friend since I liked it so well in the beginning, but promptly returned it to Amazon when mine quit working.  I have contacted customer service at mrcoffee.com to see if they will resolve this by either fixing this machine or sending a new one to me."
Origami99,5.0,"August 11, 2015","A wonderful basic coffeemaker that works consistently and never disappoints.  I'm no coffee snob so this baby does everything I need it to (and several I don't).  It makes good coffee, works flawlessly every morning, and it's easy to clean.  I think I've only used the programmable feature once so it's not something I can review with any integrity.  I'd buy this model again without hesitation."
Elle Amazoner,2.0,"March 3, 2016","Coffee set to Strong but the coffee is weak. There is no coffee aroma in the house, as it was with my previous cheap Mr. Coffee.  I'm using the correct amount of coffee, but have not better tasting coffee.  Also, the Mr. Coffee label in the front seems to be detaching already. Dissapointing."
Philip Ross Gordon,5.0,"May 26, 2013","I have had an assortment of coffeemakers over the years. Some have been far fancier than this. However, I have found this unit to be well-designed and well-built. It is simple to use, rugged, and utterly reliable. And, it makes a great cup of coffee. It has far more bells and whistles than I need. But, having purchased the gold-plated permit coffee filter to go with it, I find that it is a set-and-forget item. Highly recommended."
Lenny Howard,4.0,"April 27, 2014","This is a fine coffee maker with some very good features including the added ability to filter the water and a digital clock that can be set to turn on the coffee maker automatically at any pre-set time of your choosing.It also features auto shut off after two hours. While this is a nice feature during the work week (don't have to wonder ""did I turn it off""), it is also a pain on the weekends when we would sometimes like it to stay on and keep the coffee warm. Some way to extend the ""keep warm"" feature would make it a 5 star."
V.B.,5.0,"May 12, 2015","This machine makes a darn good cup of coffee, pours very well and surpassed my expectations. I always purchased Krups coffeemakers due to their performance and quality. However, after over thirty years with Krups their quality fell way short. Consumer Reports praised the quality of this Mr. Coffee machine and I decided to give it a try. To my great surprise this machine performed very well and I highly recommend it. And yes, let's not forget that the price is right too."
J. BLANCO,1.0,"August 16, 2014",Best coffee maker ever.  This coffee maker is truly awesome.  I've had my fair share of coffee makers and this one is the best so far.  Brews really quick too.  Highly recommended.EDIT 11/16/2014Sorry but the coffee taste starting going bad after less than 6 months.  Tried everything possible to clean it with vinegar and off the shelf coffee cleaners.  Nothing worked.  Had to toss it.
Jim Tenuto,4.0,"March 26, 2012","There's a lot to recommend in this Mr. Coffee coffee maker.  It looks great.  It is relatively easy to pour the water into the maker.  When you close the top, the spout automatically is centered over the filter and coffee.The problem is the glass carafe.  I have tried a number of different ways to pour the coffee, but 80% of the time coffee ends up on the floor or the counter.  Have plenty of paper towels handy for the quick clean-up."
Steven Fry,3.0,"January 8, 2016","I liked my Cuisinart better.  I do not like the water drip mechanism.  I feel like I have to be very careful moving it or it will snap!  I hate how the filter, how it just sits (not even well) on top of the basket, and how it can slip out of the holder.  But, I can't complain for the price I guess."
Eric Chavez,5.0,"February 15, 2015","This coffee maker has worked out great for me thus far.  Easy to program and set up.  The delay timer works well and the coffee tastes great.  It even comes with a water filtration disk that rests on top of the cup where the grinds go, which is good for those with poor quality tap water.  My only issue is that the square design allows the lid to collect a lot of condensation from the brewing process so be careful opening the lid before cleaning it out.  Overall this is a great coffee maker for the price, now I will see what kind of longevity it has.  Will update this review if there are any new developments."
NJDON,5.0,"July 4, 2014","This coffee maker replaces a BUNN which we've had and liked for a few years. When the BUNN ""passed"" we decided to try the highly recommended Mr. Coffee. GREAT coffee (and it has a ""strong brew"" button if you want even more flavor.) So far , we're pleased with the product and would recommend it to anyone wanting flavorful coffee (up to 12 cups-we typically make 5-6 cups at a time)."
Benjamin Austin,1.0,"September 8, 2016","This coffee maker broke after three months of daily use. First the water stopped warming reliably, then water stopped entering the pot altogether. While this coffee maker has a 12 month warranty, the only way to get it fixed is to bring it physically to an authorized service center, which I'm convinced are strategically located in the most out-of-the-way places imaginable to disincentives users from jumping through the hoops necessary to bother going through with repairs. (The only service center in NYC is in Howard Beach, Queens. About an hour and 15 minutes from Midtown Manhattan). But then again, what do you expect from a $30 coffee maker? I guess we live in the age of disposable appliances."
Shannon Davis,1.0,"October 27, 2015","Extremely disappointed with this machine...This model also accommodates a thermal carafe and has a setting that is supposed to ""sense"" whether you are using glass or thermal...Well mine only recognizes a thermal carafe, the problem is that I have a glass carafe and the setting automatically turns off the heating at the end of a brew if it senses the thermal carafe.  Long story short, I'm stuck with a pot of cold coffee every morning unless I drink it all before it starts cooling down. I've contacted Mr. Coffee and got an automated message asking for all kinds of manufacturers details..I don't have time for that. Ended up in the garbage and I'll be purchasing something else."
V. A. Haggerty,3.0,"February 15, 2013","For years I  had a Hamilton Beach cofee maker that did not require a glass pot.  This does and I find the glass pot hard to clean.  It has a plastic top and the opening is difficult to get your hand inside to clean.  The coffee maker does make a decent cup of coffee but I still prefer my old one.  However will use till something goes wrong with it.  The price, however, compared to other coffee makers is reasonable."
Glynda Johnsen,1.0,"August 17, 2013","Purchased this unit after seeing the review on Consumer Reports.Yes I read the Amazon reviews complaining about the smell but I figured it was probably an over exaggeration.Wrong again...  Open the top lid and your olfactory receptors are bombarded by a strong burnt plastic smell that doesn't go away.I don't understand how this got past the Mr. Coffee's QA team or the reviewers at Consumer Reports.I decided to use the unit for a week before sending it back to Amazon hoping the plastic smell would go away. During that period I discovered another problem in that the ""Brew Strength"" function would turn itself off a minute or so after the button was pushed.  I contacted Mr.Coffee about the ""Brew Strength"" problem and they made things right by sending me a different replacement coffee maker, Model# JWX31.  I'm very happy with the JWX31, no foul smell from the plastic and it makes very good coffee.  Considering the price point I have to give the JWX31 5 stars, Mr. Coffee's customer service also gets 5 stars.Regarding the BVMC-SJX33GT: With time there's less odor but it never diminishes to the point it doesn't effect the taste and aroma of the coffee.  I'm concerned about what chemical compounds are being added to my coffee not to mention the effect the plastic smell has on the taste and aroma so now it sits in my basement and will probably never be used except for spare parts as it's similar to and uses the same carafe as the JWX31.Bottom line: If your looking for a not so expensive coffee maker that makes a very good cup check out the Mr. Coffee JWX31."
HiImToni,5.0,"August 29, 2014","I had a cheap $10 no name coffee pot and ended up replacing it with this one because I wanted a programmable one and one that shuts off automatically.  I did not realize that not only would I really be extremely happy with 2 features I wanted, but the coffee tastes so much better now!!Don't waste your money on cheap stuff if you are going to plan on using it everyday.  Lesson learned!"
John Wood,2.0,"September 11, 2016","This pot worked well for approximately 18 months.  After that point, it began leaking around the basket.  We keep it clean by running vinegar through it regularly.  We cannot recommend this pot due to the leak problems that have come up."
Alice B,5.0,"January 8, 2013","This coffee maker was all we had hoped for. It was the #1 pick in Consumer Reports.It is attractive on the counter top and makes a very good cup of coffee. The timer makes it very nice to wake up to a good cup of coffee in the morning, with minimal effort. This seems to be a very reliable brand as this is not the first one we have had....This model of  Mr. Coffee is very good, even though there are many more that cost a lot more."
jtg1984,5.0,"June 18, 2014","Best Coffee maker I have ever owned.  I understand some of the other reviewers concern for the plastic smell/flavor.  I ran nothing but clean water through the unit for the first 10 brews, and the plastic concern is just an afterthought now.  You can probably get a better coffee maker, but you would have to spend a lot more money for just a little bit of gain.  Glad I did the research on this purchase."
J. A. Klawitter,2.0,"March 24, 2016","The only reason I gave it two stars is because it work well until it died. In about 5 month my coffeemaker just stop brewing coffee. The brew light will come on and click sound like it going to brew but nothing. Which disappointing, I have had pretty luck with my previous Mr Coffee units."
Brenda Cartledge,5.0,"September 8, 2020",Long lasting. Durable.
Eliza,3.0,"May 8, 2016",I loved loved loved this. Until it quit working 2 months after I bought it. It just turns on but nothing else happens. Stopped brewing. Mr.Coffee's Customer service is the worst. 😢UPDATE: Mr.Coffee apologized and is sending me a new and improved Mr. Coffee.  We are back on again. 😚
Jose,1.0,"September 23, 2019","I have family members who had this machine for years, but not for me... maybe I drink a lot of coffee or maybe it just happened to be a bad lot... Any ways It doesn't work and there is no warranty neither... so I feel very sad about that... If wasn't because of it I will give a better rate of course but since the product stop working I can't rate on what I don't have... aka good quality."
Jeanne Olson,5.0,"July 13, 2016","I've had a few Mr. Coffees and this one is super. It does not drip when you pour it. I think the filter evens out the water flow into the coffee grinds and, combined with the strength indicator, therefore makes for better coffee. Also, because it's dark it doesn't show inevitable coffee splatters. The chrome surrounds is just enough so it doesn't seem too dark."
mz,3.0,"October 9, 2013","This coffee maker does the job.  I havent really been able to tell the difference between regular and strong brews though.  Also it beeps when you start brewing and when it stops brewing and when its about to turn off the heat, at least i think it does it all those times.  I have no clue why it does this but it is really annoying, it is loud beeping and there is no way to turn it off.  Besides that i think its fine."
Claudia,1.0,"December 2, 2017","We’ve had this coffeemaker since November 2013, so it’s 4 years old, however it’s in our Hawai‘i place.  We are only there five months a year.  This machine has had 20 months use.  The warming plate has rusted out.  There are holes in it (see photo). It could be a fire hazard."
maikemoo,3.0,"April 24, 2016",I thought I could get used to a basket style coffeemaker after years and years using a cone style.  I was wrong.  The coffee is weak and I feel like I'm not getting my money's worth out of the grounds.  Never again.  Back to cone filter style once this one bites the dust.
Brittany + Robo,4.0,"January 22, 2012",We ordered this updated version of my older coffee machine.  It was a Mr. Coffee 12 cup on/off switch one.  This machine has automatic turn off which is awesome because you never worry if you left the coffee pot on.  We haven't had the need to use the optional thermal pot because we typically drink the entire pot within an hour or two.  The option for brew strength strong is awesome.  It is actually strong!  Definitely worth the price.
Joel,4.0,"July 8, 2016","Makes great coffee, on the strong setting you can use a lot less grounds and get the same coffee. I never would have thought to use a water filter, it's nice.Only negatives are that you can't get it to not shut off after 2 hours, and you can't silence the beeping when it's done or shutting off."
Rebecca Hawkins,1.0,"July 27, 2016","Coffeepot did great for awhile....then July 24, 2016 about 9 months after starting to use...it burned out. Don't know what others say about this appliance, but I will not buy again. This is not acceptable for less  than a year use. Do not buy as far as I'm concerned. No one will probably ever see this."
C,5.0,"April 22, 2017","Consumer Reports compared this coffeemaker to a much more expensive brand, and recommended this one.  Makes great coffee and you can't beat the price.  Easy to use, program and clean.  Highly recommend."
desmobob,1.0,"November 2, 2015","Noxious chemical odor fills the kitchen when I use it!  I washed all the part carefully, ran three cycles of plain water though it and it still reeked of plastic/chemicals.  I then ran a cycle with pure vinegar and it still stinks.  It's a real shame, because I love the way the thing works otherwise."
C. Bledsoe,5.0,"November 15, 2014",Had to replace my husbands old Mr Coffee when it started leaking water.  Lost count of how many yrs we'd had it.  This fit the ticket.  Good price. The black and chrome matched the kitchen. The timer was a must since he gets up @ 4:30 am to head to work. Coffee's ready when he gets up and he's out the door he goes.
margaretta lear svedman,3.0,"August 7, 2015","This product, too, arrived quickly and in excellent condition. It is very attractive in appearance and the brewing controls are easy to understand. Also, the prompts that beep when the coffee is finished brewing and when it will shut off are very useful. It is a very good money value.The disappointing features are the following: the water level indicator is on the side rear, rather than on the front so that the appliance needs to be completely pulled out from under the overhead kitchen cabinets to fill and view. The water hatch fills from the right rear so that when unloading the used filter basket a right handed person could be steamed opening it. Sadly, too, the temperature of the coffee is not hot enough and cools very quickly when cream is added."
Dale J. Nicol,5.0,"September 11, 2012","The coffee maker makes better coffee than my old Krups.......just needed to make one pot and allow the coffee grounds to stay in the basket for 1/2 day to eliminate the ""plastic taste"" from the basket.It's easy to fill with water, add coffee and start.I liked the top lid design where it automatically moves the hot water spray arm over the coffee grounds basket...so there are no operator errors when closing the cover."
MVH,1.0,"November 3, 2016",This pot was good while it lasted. It completely stopped working one day. We have had it not even 6 months. MAking a pot a day.It brewed half a pot last week and then stopped heating up. After a 2nd and third try and some trouble shooting..nothing. Save your money and buy a better pot
Don,3.0,"June 10, 2012","This unit works OK producing decent quality coffee with a minimum of fuss at a reasonable pricepoint. However, it suffers from the same affliction as its competitors:  resulting coffee out of the pot is never quite hot enough requiring the microwave treatment more often than not. What is it with coffee pot manufacturers' inability to get this straight?? Some sort of big technical problem? Or as I suspect, is it the nanny lawyers at work here to minimize lawsuits resulting from spilled coffee burns?  Methinks the latter."
AnnieV,4.0,"March 18, 2014","I bought this coffeemaker because of a review in Consumer Reports.  My old Mr. Coffee was at least 20 years old and still worked.  But it was white and was getting a little ugly.  I have had my new coffeemaker for about 3 or 4 weeks.  It performs perfectly so far and I like it because it is simple -- just push one button and it is on.  But just to be safe, I have kept my old coffeemaker."

Lummus,2.0,"August 3, 2017","This was a good little coffee maker until it started leaking internally, you probably need to spend a little more if you are going to use it daily. It dies in just under a year."
Bill Fleming,5.0,"August 8, 2012","I've come to the conclusion that some people are so picky they'll complain about anything.I've found this out with many Amazon items, not just this one.I'm sure that some people get items that are broken right out of the box but that shouldn't count for a one star review, chit happens.This is great coffee maker, just wash it out per the instructions before the first use and you'll love it."
shertherapy,1.0,"July 17, 2016","This coffee pot broke in less than 3 months :(  Got up one morning and the lights came on but it wouldn't make coffee anymore.  Heating element went out in less than 90 days. Also, the warming plate is corroded to an ugly brown and was barely keeping coffee warm after only abut 6 wks. Piece of junk. Very disappointed."
SavvyShopper,2.0,"July 9, 2011","I purchased this, because I liked the features and the look. That said, I did notice a plastic smell that other reviewers complained about. It wasn't that strong to me, and it went away, after a few uses. This is an easy-to-use coffee maker, and it makes coffee fairly quickly. The problem I had with it, was with the spring attached to the nozzle in the basket that the filter sits in. Once the filter basket was put in place, the spring never depressed enough, so that the stopper inside the basket, would allow coffee to flow down to the carafe. It's too bad that I didn't discover this, before I used it the first time, and ended up having to clean up an unexpected mess. I couldn't figure out how to fix this. I've since taken the spring off the nozzle, and removed the lid on the carafe, so that I can actually make coffee now. However, all this has managed to convince me that I should've ordered a Keurig."
sandmanrdh,3.0,"October 23, 2017",It worked just fine---but lasted less than two years. This is the second Mr. Coffee that has gone out on me in less than two years. The heating elements just quit working and there is no fix. Going to try a different brand.
EricNavy93,5.0,"November 26, 2015","My wife bought a coffee maker about 5 times more expensive for our house and I got so frustrated with it I refuse to touch it...it brews nothing but hate.  Bought this one for my hunting camp and love it so much I want to bring it home instead.  The water in our obviously rural camp is very soft, but the filter on this makes it perfect."
Eddie,3.0,"April 12, 2015","I bought one a year ago and the front buttons stopped working after 2 weeks, got it replaced by amazon.Nearly a year later the 2nd one broke again, this time the water would not pump upward and the heating pad only made the glass heat up & it would release a funky burning plastic smell. I will not be buying a Mr Coffee Machine again. Be warned."
Brittany,4.0,"January 3, 2014","I gave this coffeemaker 4 stars because overall it does it's job and there are some nice features to it. However, it doesn't do the job exceptionally well like others I've had in the past. The water-mark level is off and therefor, it took me a few tries before I got down a good, well balanced cup of joe. Also, the water filter lays right on top of the coffee filter which is inconvenient to remove each time you want to make coffee and also it gets really dirty with coffee residue; maybe I'm just picky! Conversely, the programmable brew start is nice and it's simple to use, and the automatic brew-stop actually works so you don't have burnt coffee everywhere. I got my coffeemaker on cyber Monday so it was quite a bit cheaper than usual but had I paid full price I probably would only have given three stars for the value."
L.J,1.0,"December 26, 2012","I purchased this coffee maker for my wife's birthday. She used it one time.After that, the bloody things clock went hay wire. It kept running out of control.We couldn't program it or anything. We tried to unplug it thinking maybe thatwould re-set it but, to no avail. We finally had to call sunbeam and, they sentus another one. So far, there has been no trouble.  L. Jackson"
tborland98,5.0,"August 21, 2016","Love my Mr. Coffee coffee maker. Our fancy coffee maker stopped working, and we were faced with the question, 'what should the replacement be'?After doing research and reading feedback on many sites, we wen with this Mr. Coffee 12-Cup and are very pleased! Simple, quick, easy, and budget friendly. I would purchase it again."
Justin Davis,1.0,"February 28, 2016","Coffee maker isn't brewing correctly. It beeps after about 30 seconds as if it was done brewing when it has only brewed less than a cup. Just opened it and used it for the first time but I'm past my return window. Can I get this replaced? I recently purchased the same one for work and it works great, so I know it's not user error. There's water in the time display as well. Would gladly change this to a 4 star review if I can get it replaced."
Amazon Customer,4.0,"March 31, 2017","Simple enough to operate, makes coffee. Took a star off because I think it shuts off after 5 minutes.  Nice for when I grab a cup and run, but when I want to enjoy a couple of cups the second one is usually luke warm. And i do have it set for glass not thermal."
CasperNET,5.0,"August 3, 2016","I've bought a lot of coffee makers over the years, but this is one of the best for the money. CR gave it great reviews. It might overwhelm you with all the indicator lights on the front, TMIFor those reviewers that say the finish brewing beeper is not loud enough, when it stops gurgling the coffee is ready."
Jim G- FloMo,5.0,"February 26, 2014","A great coffee maker.  Easy to use (once you play with the programming a bit by hitting all the buttons).  This coffee maker has a ""strong"" setting for stronger coffee.  Actually works great - slows the brewing process for a more concentrated coffee.  It really is easy to program if read the directions - or hit all the buttons and see what lights up (for I don't like reading directions).  All around great coffee maker!"
Big Lee,2.0,"March 11, 2015","Update 5/2/2015:  I finally found the ""leak"".  For weeks I have found a puddle of cold water under the coffeemaker after making a full pot.  I thought it must have been me being sloppy when filling the tank.  Turns out this is a FEATURE of the machine!  There is an overflow hole in the back where you fill the tank with cold water.  Two lifestyle problems with this.  First, I like to fill the machine using my faucet's spray nozzle.  Saves a lot of measuring and pouring.  But this creates waves in the tank as it's filling and when it gets near the top they slosh out the overflow hole.  Second, I need to move the machine out from under my cabinets to open the top to fill it.  With a full tank for a full pot, when I push it back under the cabinets the water in the tank sloshes and spills out the overflow hole.  I didn't notice this hole before since the whole tank inside is black.  So, Mr. Coffee Machine designers:  put the overflow hole HIGHER.  Make the coffee pot bigger to accommodate any additional water.So, with this additional annoyance I have dropped my rating from 3 starts to 2.  It does the job, but with too much annoyance for me to recommend to anyone.I brew one full pot (12 cups) most days, for use throughout the day. (I am a programmer and like to have a cup every couple of hours.)The best I can say is that it works and is cheap.The 2-hour auto shut-off is just too short for me.  Many is the time when I go for my next cup and find it has recently shut off and I either need to nuke the new cup or turn it back on and wait for it to reheat.  That variation in temperature doesn't do much for the quality of the coffee.  My previous pot had a 3-hour shut-off which was just about right for me.It decidedly favors being filled from the right:  it has a top opening door with a hinge on the left side where you add coffee grounds and pour water.  It's position on my counter is to the right of the sink, which makes it impossible to fill water from the sink using the spray hose.As others have suggested, it tends to leak.  The basket holding the coffee filter is flat on the bottom and tends to retain some liquid after brewing.  The spring-loaded value that lets you remove the pot during brewing is weak and does not close quickly enough when removing the pot later, and some water drips out onto the hot plate.The LCD display is too small, inset deeply so it does not get much ambient light, and I can't read it without a flashlight - needs a back-light or to be angled to get ambient light.The power cord is quite short, making moving it around (e.g., to pull it out from under cabinets to open the top door) difficult.The labels on the controls are also quite small and difficult to read without a light.Finally, I don't much like the colors:  lots of black and some chrome plastic.  Does nothing for our kitchen decor.  Wish it came in other colors (like white).15-year-old Braun that we loved but started leaking after 15 years.  Wish Braun still made that model.  I bought it because a) it was cheap, and b) it was highly rated on Consumer Reports online."
Kathryna,1.0,"April 30, 2016","What a disappointment this coffee maker turned out to be! We bought it and were happy with it since delivery in June 2015. It quit 9 months later in March of '16. Turns out that's about average for how long these last, according to other reviewers. Good luck!"
Pauline E. Miller,1.0,"August 15, 2015",This has to be one of the worse coffee pots I have ever paid for. The coffee is never hot. It cut off to soon. The coffee grinds spill over into the pot. I have owned many Mr. Coffee and this has to be the worst. I also paid for extended  warranty and still have not received. I hate this coffee pot.
Goodguy,5.0,"December 27, 2013",I bought this because it was top rated in Consumer Reports. It was a birthday gift for my best friend and she loves it.She is a coffee nut and says this is the best coffee maker she has ever owned. Unlike many she has owned in thepast this one keeps her coffee hot. I've tasted coffee brewed by this machine and it really is excellent. I'll buy one of these formyself when my current coffee maker goes bad.
Robbie,3.0,"June 24, 2012","I love it. Was looking for a simple coffee maker for my outdoor kitchen and this is it.  Only negative is the water filter cartridge.  It just sits on top of the basket but not very well.  It seems like it was an afterthought.  No notches or anything for it to clip into so it just sits there cockeyed and loose.  It works, just a bit annoying from a picky standpoint."
Dmac,1.0,"April 18, 2015","I should have kept the packaging on this one. I would have returned it. I agree with others, you get an odd taste of plastic in your coffee. Not what I want to taste first thing in the morning.  I would not buy this item again. Very disappointed in my purchase and could kick myself for assuming it was a good purchase and threw out the packaging!"
bonedoc,2.0,"April 22, 2014","OK, the machine looks cheap and that's because it is, I understand and did not mark it down for that.  The machine that I received had an LED display that was dark, so dark it could not be read to set the time without my wife holding a flashlight on the display.  Also on our unit it was not possible to preset a brew time so perhaps our unit had an electrical issue.  Even if it had worked I would not have liked the cheap construction.  Ours had a filter ring that appeared to sit within the plastic housing that holds the coffee grounds.  For the life of me I couldn't find a place where it seemed stable so I would not have used it either.  IMO it's worth spending a bit more to get a quality machine.Update after several months:  I ordered a second unit and it worked fine for several months, at that time the the timer function failed so that I could not change the time at which it would come on in the morning.  So my first machine was faulty from the get go and the second lasted only a few months.  No wonder Consumer Reports has removed this machine from their recommended list and 31% of the amazon reviews are 3 stars or less."

Elmasri,3.0,"February 21, 2016",I bought this coffee maker on nov 29 2015 i got to admit i really liked the way it work for two and a half months (it was not used Daly) after that it just stop working. period i went to see if i could return it or get it replace. but Amazon said the 30 day return period has expired.If you're considering buying this coffe maker my advice is don't you will need another one in two month's:(...
Kindle Customer,5.0,"May 13, 2014","It took 3 different coffee pot purchases before I found one I really liked. This is the one!  I like everything about it.  It completely lives up to the description of details listed.  I wish I had bought this pot first.  Now I can have hot coffee waiting for me when I get up in the morning and it stays hot.  It is easy to operate and fill, unlike another one I purchased earlier.  Do not be leary of purchasing this coffee pot."
Tammy L. Rankins,4.0,"July 6, 2017","Great little coffee maker! Works perfectly! I have owned this item for several years and it has never failed! I even purchased a second one for work.

David W. Auterson,4.0,"June 7, 2014","Replaced an old Bunn maker (leaking/too big) with this and we are very pleased with it.  I ran water through it first and did get a plastic odor - but only once.  Controls are easy to use and the coffee is great.  We like the taste better than the Bunn, likely because water pours quickly through it.  This maker also keeps the coffee hotter than the old machine.  No worries, no complaints, highly recommend."
fla_grl,5.0,"December 18, 2014",this is probably the best coffee pot for a couple reasons. The first thing is the price and second it really does the job. I've had many that were much more expensive and were not nearly as good. I bought it because of the good reviews and I figured at the price what could it hurt. I like that you can brew  regular or strong and it's very easy to get the pot going quickly.
Bobby G. Ballew III,5.0,"June 23, 2017",Good machine. I like being able to adjust the brew strength. Makes good coffee. I had a koureg for a while and got tired of machines messing up and paying an arm and leg for those stupid cups. This is the answer and im glad i bought it.
Retool,4.0,"July 8, 2012","This coffee maker has a great price, it's is good looking , easy to operate. The brew time is short. The one thing that takes away from it is after finishing the brew time, the coffeemaker has only a 2 hour hold time then the coffee starts to cool. In a 2 person household, thats 3 cups of coffee in a hour. Even for a coffee lover thats rushing it.  A 3 to 4 hour hold time would be better.Possibly the hold time could be programable."
K. Kelsey,3.0,"October 24, 2014","I like this coffee maker it makes great coffee. The only problem I have with it is the water purifier. When you use it for making 10 to 12 cups of coffee.

So now when I have to make a lot of coffee I just don't use the water purifier.."

Beth Jinkerson,3.0,"June 4, 2017","Purchased in Sept 2015 and I loved this maker - sleek clean lines, sturdy carafe, holding tank, timer...all a great improvement on our last maker that gave up the ghost after 15 years of use (a wedding present).  But I can no longer recommend because this last weekend the heating element stopped working and it's no longer percolating.  Turns out the $3 2-year warranty was the best thing I could buy because I get to ship this hunk o' junk back and get a full refund of the purchase price as an amazon gift card (so I can apply it toward a new maker of my choice)"
Nancy,5.0,"April 20, 2019","We’ve had one of these for several years, just bought a second (the 1st is still working, we just needed a 2nd) to replace a different brand. We’ve never had a problem with it, which is why we returned to it when another was needed. No issues at all, works perfectly!"
Gary,3.0,"May 11, 2015","This item was purchased in Nov 2014. The coffee pot developed a fog on the digital screen and started coming on by itself - not programmed. The manufacturer was called and they offered, with no hassle, to replace the purchase.  This was done and the second one (replacement) also started brewing without the program set. The second one is also being returned and replaced, with no hassle, with a third coffee pot. It is a nice item, easy to clean and looks great but we will now unplug the appliance overnight."
H. S. Gersten,5.0,"November 9, 2015",Much better in every way than the maker I paid four times more for a few years ago. Using paper filters bought in quantity  and freshly ground Brazil dark coffee from Fairway. 5 scoops to 28 oz. of water is about right. Commercial brands of coffee just create brown dishwater. Tried most of them and will not go back.
Merilee F,1.0,"June 13, 2016",This machine worked fine for a while but then quit completely. Piece of junk. Online I see that they know their circuit board quits but they keep selling them. BUYER BEWARE!  Mine lasted less than 6 months and of course can't return or exchange.
Tiffany L.,5.0,"February 15, 2014","I bought this coffeemaker because I'm not a morning person. I absolutely love dinking coffee but I hate waking up knowing I have to go prepare it and then wait... I looked into Mr. Coffee because it's definitely a cheap alternative for what I'm looking for (a coffee maker that brews a delicious cup of coffe automatically). I dont know why, but I got curious and decided to read the negative reviews only after I purchased it. So I was pretty nervous when I read things like ""the coffee pot lets out this disgusting oder and the coffee tastes like it has plastic in it"" or ""returned next day"" or ""my coffee pot leaked and the water wasnt going into the pot correctly"". I was very unhappy and I justified to myself that the bad reviews were due to quality (its like a $20 product). When it came I was adamant to do everything right.  I cautiously read the directions manual to make sure I do everything exactly the way it tells me to. I was instructed to soak the coffee pot, the lid, and the removable coffee filter in a ""mild detergent"". I let them soak in the sink for about 15 minutes. Afterwards I was instructed to fill the entire coffee pot with cold water and run it through without a paper filter. To my relief there was no disturbing oder or horrific after taste. Its just an awesome coffee maker that wakes me up to the sensational coffee smell every morning."
Brian F.,4.0,"December 29, 2014","I like everything about this coffeemaker except that the hotplate automatically shuts off at 2 hours.  My preference would be 4 hours.  Also, to really pick nits, I would like the brew strength to stay on the strong setting instead of defaulting to the regular setting each time I use the coffeemaker.  That being said, I am completely satisfied with this unit."
TomCat,1.0,"March 11, 2014",The first automatic drip coffee maker I ever bought made excellent coffee for over ten years.  This one lasted three months and it is my fifth (others from different manufacturers) in under two years.  It seems that quality control for this entire class of product is to assure that there is no quality..  I'm going back to the old fashioned coffee pot that you heat on the stove top.  I recommend that you do not purchase this item.
akorngiebel,2.0,"November 7, 2012","Received this coffee maker today and am disappointed with the display.  I either have one that doesn't work properly, or the design is not good.  The area of the clock display is not back-lit.  I cannot see the time, am/pm, or delayed brew time without holding a lighter or flashlight up to try to see it. Would appreciate comment to determine whether I have a defective device or a poorly designed one."
Ed,5.0,"January 9, 2015","No complaints about this coffemaker. Glass Cafe very easy to pour, and no problems pouring coffee. Very easy to program too.Had this coffeemaker for 2 years, no problems. Top rated machine too. However, I have to admit I purchased Keurig machine so I no longer have this coffeemaker. Love the convenience of the Keurig!. And assortment of drinks."
Chasity,5.0,"September 26, 2015","I was hesitant to purchase this after reading some of the other reviews. However, statistically  speaking the good outweighed the bad.Upon unpacking the coffee maker I immediately proceeded to run ""cleaning cycles"" through it. Primarily because of the bad reviews indicating a burning plastic smell and poor tasting coffee. I utilized a more intense cleaning then the accompanying instructions advised.I handwashed the carafe and filter container by hand with just soap and water. Next, I added equal parts white vingar and water to the reservoir (6 cups each & I did not use the water filter pack during any of the cleaning cycles). I then chose the ""strong"" brew cycle. When it was approximately half way through the brew cycle I turned the power off. I then let it sit for 30 minutes. Once the 30 minutes was over I restarted the ""strong"" brew cycle. When it was complete I ran two more brew cycles using just water.Once the cleaning cycles were complete I proceeded with prepping my coffee maker for auto brewing the next morning. I do encounter a slight amount of water spillage as I'm pouring water from the carafe into the water reservoir. However, that could totally be my fault because I tend to pour at a quick, strong pace. The auto brew timer is super easy to set. And, the ""delay brew"" is lit up so that I know it's programmed and ready to go.The next morning I awoke to a nice hot pot of coffee that smelled and tasted great. I love that the coffee maker signals completion of brewing and when the auto shut-off feature is happening with 3 short consecutive beeps.We brew a pot every weekday morning and sometimes twice on the weekends. We have had no problems whatsoever.I know that the initial cleaning brew cycles may seem tedious, but, it is super simple and well worth it. They also should be ran about once a month as part of your monthly maintenance  with any coffee maker.I also purchased the permanent filter and have enjoyed the cost efficacy of not needing to buy paper filters.I would highly recommend this coffee maker."
Gary Evans,5.0,"May 31, 2018","I'm surprised at the negative reviews.  Mine has none of the problems cited by reviewers.  Additionally, it seems to me that it is exceptionally fast at brewing coffee."
L. Dyess,1.0,"March 16, 2014",Terrible mistake buying this one. I wanted a simple to use coffee maker and this one was a pain. The coffee filter holder has some sort of check valve that if you don't line up the filter cup and or get the pot just right it will over flow the top of the filter cup and get the grinds all inside the makers water tank and inside your coffee pot. Now you have to wash out the maker and pot to get rid of the grinds and start all over. I thought it was a fluke but two other family members have done the same thing and I even done it again after I double checked it to make sure all was good.If you get this you can't use a small filter to make a small pot of coffee because it will sometimes drip over the filter and then float grinds into your pot and inside the filter cup.Way to much headach just to make and enjoy a cup of coffee.
FLbookworm22,2.0,"June 23, 2014","There is NO automatic cleaning cycle on my coffee maker.  That's one of the features that made me purchase this model as cleaning the coffee maker properly was an issue we had with our old model.  If that was the only problem, I could probably get over it and give it 4 stars.  Unfortunately, in less than a year, it appears the spring that opens the flow from the grounds to the carafe has failed causing the COFFEE MAKER TO OVERFLOW almost every time we make coffee.  I noticed another reviewer said that only could happen if you accidentally used 2 filters- NOT TRUE.  We have a Mr Coffee gold filter and it happens ALL the time.  We've tried brewing smaller pots of coffee (instead of the 8 cups we normally make- and we have the glass carafe so theoretically should be able to brew up to 12 cups) and nothing helps.  I finally figured out the spring wasn't functioning properly when I removed the carafe ""mid-cycle"" and coffee continues to flow all over the counter from the filter basket.  I think this spring is getting stuck and not opening properly when the carafe is in place causing the coffee maker to overflow.  I've tried standing at the coffee maker the entire time it's brewing and constantly moving the carafe to a new position and while that helps, it still doesn't completely resolve the overflow issue.  VERY disappointed.  This is our 2nd Mr Coffee- we had our first for 7 years with no problems until hard water finally ruined it.  We expected at least a year from this unit.  Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case."
eyre,1.0,"November 14, 2013","it's a very fragile thing.  The cord length is a big problem.  cord was maybe a foot long; it was so very short, it could not go where previous coffee makers have all gone because it couldn't reach any outlets.  The cord is even retractable, although, I don't know why, since it is so short.  Should I cut it off and put a new one on?  A few inches would do the trick.  I may have to give it away, I don't particularly want to keep my coffee maker on the floor nor make a 6 inch extension.  The water spout inside also doesn't always get all the grounds, the off-center drip will often cause the filter to curl, then the water starts going around the outside of the filter and you've got yourself some coffee-tinted water."
Dar Loves Montana,5.0,"December 1, 2014","This is my third Mr. Coffee.  So far so good. I've only been using it about 3 weeks. I like the redesign on the filter holder over my older model. I like that it auto detects the optional thermal carafe. The controls are a bit easier to read than my last model, which quit on me after about 3.5 years of use.  I think the coffeemaker is a good value."
Snow on the Roof,5.0,"November 10, 2013",Consumer Reports rated this model a best buy.  I agree.  It makes good coffee at the correct temperature and is easy to use and clean.  The clock and timer are easy to set. All of these points are important to me as I rapidly approach the Golden Years (maybe I'm there already).  My only complaint is the automatic shut-off is 2 hours and I would like 3.  It's probably a safety issue.
CharCats,5.0,"March 13, 2015",We bought this brand & model to replace the expensive Cuisinart we had- which didn't last but a couple years. Since this was half the price & had all the same features to set a brew time and all- it was a great buy. Been using it several months now & it's been reliable. Now to see how many years it will last. I'm hoping it's quite awhile.
John,2.0,"August 24, 2016","I am buying the second one to replace the original purchase on 07/25/'15. The original one broke down in the middle of brewing cafe, and I have no idea for what's going on.  The reason for buying the same model is that I also purchased DRD95 8-Cup Stainless Steel Thermal Carafe, for which I wish to continue to use.If the new one breaks down again, I am done with Mr. Coffee brand."
Adrian Maldonado,1.0,"March 12, 2015","I am not sure if it was something that was wrong with my particular coffee pot, but it broke in less than two months.  The heating mechanism just went out without warning.  One morning after brewing some coffee for the day, I heard a weird sound coming from the pot, like it was overheating or something and it was struggling to try to make more coffee.  I left for work, and my wife attempted to reheat the coffee I had made 3 hours earlier.  The heating plate did not heat.  The following morning, the whole thing refused to even make coffee.On top of that this is not a slim coffee pot, it takes up a lot of counter space.The only plus is it brewed great coffee...for a month and a half, but really any new coffee pot will make great tasting coffee when its new."
chris,3.0,"March 27, 2016","My husband bought this for me as a Christmas gift, and while I absolutely love it. (All of the features, along with the price) I am unhappy with the fact that the actual pot broke. I was washing it by hand ( I don't wash it in the dishwasher) a big chunk of it broke right off. It was a clean break, and it came off as I was rinsing the inside and wiping it with my hand. I'm rather unhappy since I've only had this for a few months and have only used it a handful of times. I'm also having difficulty finding a replacement for it as well."
steve,3.0,"January 8, 2013","This coffee maker worked wonderfully for 8 months when it just quit working halfway through a pot.  Not sure why, but all lights work.  The warmer will not get hot and just will not brew anything.  Called Mr. Coffee and they are sending out a new unit, unfortunately it is not the same model.  The worst of it is I had purchased the thermal pot with the original and will not work with the replacement pot, an extra item that cost $20 more.  I guess I am out the approx $20 for the thermal pot.  It probably is the micro switches that controls through the timer that has failed.  Probably go back to the one switch old fashion units that are pretty bullet proof....I will hook a separate timer to the outlet if I want a delay feature.  Very disappointing that we cannot make any new products in this world that last!!!"
P. Yarber,5.0,"January 19, 2014","What a great coffee pot! This was recommended in Consumer Reports as making some of the best coffee. And the price is great. I have not had a Mr. Coffee in a long time (have been using Cuisinart products) and was surprised at how much they have improved. Not cheap looking and operates as it should. No dripping carafe, easy to clean. Very happy with this coffee maker."
Lori,5.0,"May 30, 2019","This easily makes 12 cups of hot coffee, ready to drink at your convenience.I love the delayed brew setting and the charcoal filter!And it stays hot for 2 hours"
RCG Customer,5.0,"May 24, 2015","Great coffee maker! It has a really nice ""strong"" feature. My wife likes coffee toward the mild side. Whereas, I like mine a bit stronger. This coffee maker satisfies both worlds with a simple click! Also, if you have stainless appliances, this is the coffee maker for you! Matches our stainless steel appliances perfectly."
Lydia Williams,1.0,"September 2, 2018","This coffee maker did ok for a while, but beware: After some time and use, the button to turn on the machine stopped functioning properly. We now have to press the “on” button sometimes DOZENS of times before it actually turns on. It’s extremely frustrating and makes me want to tear my hair out on a daily basis. They just don’t make things like they used to. Advice: Choose a simpler machine with a “switch” to turn on and off instead of a button."
Richard Crespo Silverio,5.0,"May 6, 2015","Product of the year in 2011. I could not agree any more. This coffee maker is the best and for a really good price. Love it's functionality such as the timer to make your coffee in the morning at a desired time, it's indicator to let you know if the coffee pot you are using is the glass pot that comes with the product or the steel pot which you can purchase separately, it also has a nice digital clock (wish it had a light though, that would have been nice), it has a sexy look and it's very easy to use. I also like the spacious water reservoir, so pouring water in the coffee maker does not spill. I strongly recommend."
Junebugs,4.0,"July 29, 2013","Cons: Only ""One"" noticeable thing, pouring coffee into cup, with pot lid down/closed causes dripping. Simply lift lid a little when pouring to solve.A little bigOtherwise, we're satisfied with it. We had no noticeable problem with ""Plastic"" taste tainting the coffee even on the first brew.Looks clean and neat and has a few nice features. Overall I recommend"
Patricia Romanski,5.0,"February 15, 2014",Makes great hot coffee very fast.  Good looking on my counter. Easy to prepare and clean up.Our previous coffee maker had a closed carafe that was supposed to be 12 cups.  We were certainly fooled.  In no way was it 12 cups even if 6 oz. was the measurement used.  Clean up was not so easy.  We are now getting 12 cups and much better tasting coffee and glad we made the switch.  Garbage is where the other one went.
Kelly Mcloughlin,1.0,"May 22, 2015","After 2 1/2 months it is no longer brewing coffee.  It started malfunctioning the other day and initially I thought nothing of it.  I turned the coffee maker off and it appeared to still be on.  After a few more attempts I had to unplug it for it to finally turn off.  The next day it was able to brew, but when we were through I turned the machine off.  All the lights were off so I believed everything was ok.  Fast forward an hour, I walk into kitchen and smell burnt coffee.  Although the machine was turned off the burner continued heating the pot cooking what was left inside of it.  I am just grateful I was home to unplug it before something worse happened."
Dakota's Mom,1.0,"January 9, 2016",The first one arrived broken.  Amazon replaced it with no problems.  Thanks Amazon.The second one lasted 13 months!  One month past warranty.The first cup or two tasted great.  The remaining cups burned quickly.
Z,5.0,"October 16, 2015",Bought two of these for the office since they were the #1 Best Seller in Coffee Machines on Amazon and a really good price.  I ran a few pots of hot water thru each to clean and test the units and both are working properly. After a few days of coffee making nobody has complained about them so they get 5 stars.
Ensar Demirkan,2.0,"January 30, 2012","I owned Mr. Coffee machines before. All served me well. This one has a big flaw. The pot has been designed so poorly that every single time when pouring coffee, you spill some out of the cup.., especially first two cups. That is the case even if you are very careful and pour very slowly.The machine itself is very good. But the pot is awful."
Bay Area Cooler,4.0,"May 20, 2014","Works good. Kinda neat to have the timer so that you can start it at a time you want. The design needs improvement. The entire case is essentially a big water tank and so water condenses everywhere. You cannot really ""dry"" this. Use of water filter is good... actually more than filtering water, it would prevent backsplashing of the coffee+water mix."
Danielle Chiz,4.0,"May 17, 2016","I really enjoyed this coffee maker- lots of great features like the timer, etc. Bought it in September, and now May it just stopped working. Super disappointing, but Mr.Coffee has a one year warranty and it was very easy to get a replacement sent to me. No need to return to the old model. So worth the money!"
Tim,3.0,"January 9, 2012","Love the design and features!  However, the water compartment stunk REALLY bad when I first opened it up.  I let it air out for a day, then ran one clean cycle water only, one clean cycle water/vinegar, two clean cycles water only, another water/vinegar clean cycle, and two more water only clean cycles.  The smell did not dissipate...let it air out for awhile then ran several brew cycles with freshly ground coffee beans.  It tasted like oatmeal, and the grounds wreaked of the plastic smell.  Perhaps the smell will dissipate after 6 months or a year, but who knows.  I then made a fresh pot in my 10 year old Cuisinart that leaks all over the counter, but it tasted great.  If taste matters, I would suggest something other than this Mr. Coffee model."
Nancy J. Martin,5.0,"November 28, 2016","Does what it is supposed to do.  I finally learned to set the timer (I didn't bother to read the directions), so you can definitely infer from this that the process is pretty easy and intuitive.  And I bought it for the auto shut off.  And that works too."
Carolyn R.,1.0,"September 4, 2015","What a waste of money- we have only had this coffee maker for a few months, and it already is breaking down.  The ""plastic smell"" never completely went away, the water isnt getting hot enough so even the best quality coffee is bitter- I dont even look forward to the first cup in the morning anymore.  Another annoying breakdown- the ""beep"" that indicates it is finished brewing happens 10 seconds after the brewing starts. Im so disappointed."
Mike,2.0,"July 16, 2018","I have purchased two of these, both have lasted around 15 months before they stop working unexpectedly- planned obsolescence? Looking for a replacement now, probably a Braun or some other brand. Really disappointed in Mr. Coffee, it used to be my go-to brand...."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"March 17, 2016","Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Our SECOND Mr. Coffee coffee maker just died this morning. Both lasted only about 3 months. I am not sure how it has such high reviews. I can't imagine it's a coincidence that both pots pooped out at around the same interval. We will NOT be looking to the Mr. Coffee brand for future purchases."
tennisplr,4.0,"January 6, 2013","Glad I got this as our old Black and Decker wasn't producing hot enough water to brew properly. After some experimentation(since I'm a coffee purist), I locked into the right combination for us...6 measures of beans,medium grind, and 81/2 cups of filtered water). I have to get up before my wife so I get to do it my way, but she's happy with my coffee and that starts the day out right."
J. Antoni,1.0,"February 7, 2014","The coffee maker comes with an extremely high ranking from Consumer Reports and overall its function, design, and operation seem consistent with that ranking; however, we've noticed a plastic like taste to our coffee which suggests that the plastic materials in the brewing path are contaminating the finished coffee.  We followed the manufacturers setup instructions and even ran five  add'l pots of hot water though the machine before brewing the first pot, but the problem remains.We're aware of the fact that most manufactured plastics leach some toxins (e.g. BPA) into food/water, but this product seems particularly problematic.  At this point, I'm not sure if it's a health risk or not, but it certainly leaves its share of doubts with the obvious plastic taste to our brewed coffees."
Jane M.,4.0,"April 3, 2015","Mr Coffee is always reliable. the design of this product is a bit over the top for what it is.  Not sure why all the buttons and stuff but it looks hi-tech and some are drawn to that.  For me, it makes a good cup of coffee and that is what counts.  (I also like the two hour shut off.  Don't have to worry about it overheating.)"
Kindle Customer,2.0,"November 13, 2014","The coffee pot is as posted.  Ironically, the plastic smell has not gone away after three months of use.  The taste of the coffee is absolutely fine, but everytime I open the coffee maker and smell that chemical, I wonder how many days I have left.  I am going to buy another pot only because of the smell of this one.  Otherwise it works great."
M,1.0,"February 9, 2014","There's no sense rating a coffee maker on its ability to brew coffee.  That's like judging a person's character on their ability to exist.  Supposedly, the BVMC-SJX33GT can be programmed to wake you up in the morning with a steaming cup of joe.  That claim is a steaming cup of lies; unless you don't mind your coffee 3 minutes earlier compounded daily.  That's right, ... Mr. Coffee failed to include an accurate device that's been around since the mid 1800's ... the electric clock.  What started as accusations between my wife and I about each others ability to set the morning timer developed into a realization that the coffee machine clock gains about 22 minutes each week.  If you've ever programmed a clock that slowly steps through each minute and you've missed your mark and had to repeat the process, you can imagine how much fun it is to be the unfortunate owner of this embarrassment in electrical engineering as you reprogram it over and over again.  Times like these make me question whether 2 day shipping is really worth the miserly 30 day return policy."
tvjames,1.0,"January 29, 2016","Updated:Born: Nov. 2015, Died: May 12.  I used this coffee maker twice weekly, but today it refuses to make coffee. Other reviews suggest the relay has died. Its life was far too short.  Rest in pieces, you hunk of junk.Original Review:So... it's a high quality coffee maker for all the reasons everyone else has said.  But, I wouldn't buy it again given the chance.My old coffee maker (also a Mr. Coffee) simply had an on/off switch. When the light started flickering, my wife recommended I replace it before the world came to a screeching halt (i.e., the thing actually stopped working and she had to deal with a coffee-less me).  I bought this one because it was inexpensive and well-rated, figured I ought to treat-mah-self to a small upgrade.But, the way I used my coffee maker was not like that of a lot of people, I guess.  Long ago I learned that if you put water to the 8 line in a Mr. Coffee Maker pot, it won't reach the 8 mark in the reservoir and when you make coffee, you won't get coffee to the 8 mark in the pot when all is said and done.  So I'd make 7 or 8 or 10 (1 scoop to one whatever those lines mean) and if there was some left over, I'd leave it in the pot and just make new on top of it with fresh grounds/fresh filter the next day.  And I'd keep it on much of the day so as the mood struck me (working from home), I could go and get a nice hot cup of coffee.  While my method may be unconventional (or appalling) to some coffee drinkers, it worked for me.  This coffee maker fails me in two regards: the heating element under the pot isn't as powerful/quick as the one I replaced.  If the coffee has cooled and I turn the coffee maker back on, I often find myself using the microwave to finish the job.  Secondly, it turns off automatically after 2 hours with a rather annoying beeping.  (The beeping is annoying.  It does that to signal that it's completed a brew, or shortly after you turn it on to reheat coffee, long before it's even tepid, and again when it's been on for two hours and is deciding to go to sleep. My other coffee maker was a mute pack animal that did the job without calling attention to itself.)Speaking of calling attention to itself - the coffee maker is quite attractive, from the shiny metallic plastic to the very pleasing colored lights that give it a high-tech appearance. The buttons have a nice look to them.  It's not too difficult to set the delayed start but doesn't repeat on its own and it has a brew strength setting button for some reason, so whenever I want to brew a new batch, I have to press two buttons - one to turn it on, a second to select ""strong"" (as opposed to the standard/weak default).  What's not visible on the front is the water level - it's on the side. I have to pull it out and turn it sideways to see the water fill line.  The fill area is also rather small (you need to use the pot or other pitcher with a precise spout to pour water into the reservoir.  I need to pull it out anyhow because the lid flips to the side and stands higher than the height from counter to upper cabinets.  I would really recommend looking for a coffee maker with a removable water tank. Standard Mr. Coffee pitcher, identical to the one I donated, complete with the slightly uneven spout that causes the coffee to pour in a nice, tight, twisting stream without any splashing.  (Watch it sometime while pouring slowly - you can also see how liquid twisting as it goes - kinda neat.)The coffee maker also includes a water filter that goes below the water dispenser and above the grounds and coffee filter.  You're supposed to change the filter about once a month. They're pretty inexpensive on Amazon (the replacements I ordered shipped directly from China passing through customs as some kind of Sony product).  When you're adding new coffee, you turn the water dispenser arm out of the way, pick up the filter and then... um.... there's no real logical place to put the water filter.  I balance it on the open lid, but it would be nice if they had added a few plastic tabs to the lid for just that purpose so it's not precarious. The other option is to put it on a clean plate or in a separate pitcher of water or something.So there you have it. If you have a wide open counter with nothing about it, like the ability to set the timer to have coffee ready when you wake up (and are disciplined enough to remember to do it), don't need fresh coffee at a moment's notice throughout the day, don't mind a device that beeps at you, and want a nice looking coffee maker with a water filter, this one fits the bill.  I know I gave it four stars, and then mostly groused about it, but hopefully this gives you some additional context when researching your purchase."

From most angles, in most light, it is virtually impossible to see the digits--they do not glow or light up  At night, they cannot be seen at all.

That's true, but it goes away after about the first five uses."
Smokinerbs,1.0,"November 22, 2013","Returned the first one because the 'STRONG' brew setting doesn't work, replacement doesn't work either.  Other than that it heats the water to make coffee, nothing special. Had to buy the thermal carafe extra and that only holds 8 cups. The only reason I am keeping it is because its cheap.  But for a few more dollars I should've bought something better as I don't expect this will last very long at 2 pots a day."

It's a pretty simple process to scoop in some coffee grounds, add some water and press the start button, right? That's what I've always found to be true before.Enter my new coffeemaker, the Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker. Its feature set promises much, and fails in one big area - enough to lower my rating to two stars. The water filter is supposed to remove most of the chlorine from the water as it brews coffee, producing a cup of delicious, fresh-tasting coffee. I wish I could attest to that. Instead, every time I use the water filter, the coffeemaker overflows.I've tested this variety of ways - with only water and no coffee grounds, making only half a pot of coffee, and making a full pot of coffee. It doesn't matter - as long as the filter is in the basket, the machine overflows. If there is some magic trick to putting this thing in, I haven't found it. I have found that it can fit pretty securely in the filter basket, clicking into place, but again it doesn't make a difference.The coffeemaker does work pretty well when I don't use the filter, and if you are not in the market for a coffeepot that has this feature, then you may be satisfied with this one. As for me, I just don't trust this appliance and feel as if I have to stand over it every time I brew coffee in case it overflows again. I'll be buying a new coffeemaker soon - I'm pretty tired of cleaning the counters and floors every I want coffee. My new coffeemaker will NOT be a Mr. Coffee device.The machine also offers an alarm that beeps when the coffeemaker finishes a brew cycle. I'm not really sure who needs this feature when the coffeemaker has a working pause feature that allows you to pour a cup of coffee before the brew job is complete. So far, this one seems to work in that area. I haven't found a way to deactivate this alarm and this could be an issue when someone wants to quietly make coffee in the morning without making unnecessary noise that may wake other members of the household. This feature seems more like an unnecessary bell and whistle designed to boost the feature set but without much value in the real world. I wouldn't mind this feature so much if you could turn it off.I can't say much more about this coffeemaker, other than reiterating the fact that the frequent overflows have left me unable to trust it and even though I have used it without the water filter successfully, I keep looking for the next issue."
Ryan Smith,1.0,"July 17, 2015","This item is a piece of junk.  It stopped working after 5 weeks.  Amazon would not help me out because their return policy is 30 days.  They made me call Mr Coffee and they tried to blame it on me for not cleaning the coffee maker as instructed in the Manuel.  The Manuel recommended to clean after 30 uses which I only use on the weekend so it had less than 30 uses.  Mr Coffee finally agreed to ship me a new one in 8 days.  So now I have to go without coffee for over a week...My advise is you get what you pay for, Mr Coffe is a piece of junk, and that Walmart has better customer service than Amazon."
Iver Rose,5.0,"July 10, 2013","This was the best buy on Consumer Reports.  It works well, makes strong coffe which is important to me.  Also i can read the water level really easily. On another coffee maker I have it drives me crazy trying to figure out whether the water is at the correct level.  I'll probably replace it with another one of these. Great value at $34.00 and I love my prime deliveries. Quick and free."
williamb,2.0,"April 28, 2018",this product isnt working anymore (less than 3 years and wasnt used daily- bummer) usually they make solid products - buying a new one but definitely not this brand
1mikeglv,4.0,"April 16, 2015","IT'S OKAY BUT WE HAD A MORE EXPENSIVE MR; COFFEE, COFFEE MAKER BEFORE AND IT WENT COMPLETELY KA-PUT AND IT SEEMS THAT WE'RE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH THIS ONE. WE'RE GIVING THIS A 4 STAR RATING ONLY BECAUSE IT WORKS AS WELL AS THE MORE COSTLY COFFEE MAKER ( WHEN IT WORKED) AND HAS ONLY HAD MINOR PROBLEMS, POSSIBLY DUE TO USER ERROR ( BUT DOUBTFUL)."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"June 10, 2016","This was a giant let down.  I've purchased Mr. Coffee products before and never had an issue.  But this is a truly awful piece of equipment.  When trying to brew my first pot of coffee (ten-cups), I noticed it was very loud and steaming quite a bit.  Over an hour later I only had a few cups of coffee in the pot.  I figured I did something wrong so I unplugged it, cleaned it, and checked everything.  When I tried again the same thing happened.  After about 45 minutes of loud sputtering and steaming it just stopped.  I had maybe two cups in the pot.  The machine hasn't worked since.  Huge Disappointment.  I will never buy a Mr. Coffee product again."
VivLA,4.0,"April 8, 2015","So far so good.  At first I had to get my measurements right for the amount of coffee I wanted.  That took a little trail and error.  I was so use to using my old coffee pot of over ten years, I knew exactly the amount of grind needed for it to be perfect. All in all I have no problems with the pot, it works as it should."
Natalie,1.0,"November 3, 2015","I used this coffee maker for less than a month every other day and now it just won't turn on. Also, the clock face always fogged up and now there is water stuck inside.... if it still worked that would bother me but what a waste of money. Definitely wouldn't buy again"
katzstuff,5.0,"February 5, 2012","This particular Mr.Coffee maker makes great coffee. The coffee is hot, some other coffee makers do not make hot coffee.  I also like the button for regular or strong brew. I ordered the thermal carafe that can be used with the coffee maker, no need to keep the hot plate on the coffee.  The coffee maker knows which pot you are using and the hot plate does not get hot.  Love this coffee maker."
Bonfire84,5.0,"November 5, 2013",Oh my!!  I wished I gave my old coffee pot up months or even YEARS sooner!! Love having the option of a extra brew strength to just the way I love it!  We also purchased the gold coffee filter to go with it and have been VERY satisfied after owning this for the last 2 months without any problems. And we actually enjoy the part when it beeps at you to let you know its turning off!
Kevin A Hallgren,2.0,"September 20, 2014","I also recommend buying a mop and strainer if you purchase this coffee pot.  Three attempts in a row this brewer got way too many coffee grinds in the coffee.  The water would just sit in the coffee grinds and not drain into the pot.  Then I figured out that if you don't place the grinds holder in EXACTLY the right place it will do this odd behavior, totally ruining your coffee.  I feel like I need to keep close attention to this coffee maker with the lid open just to ensure it doesn't cause a mess.  The two stars is only because, at the end of the day, I did get a cup of coffee out of it (with more grinds than I care for though)."
Steve Lukacs,3.0,"December 3, 2013",Purchased this product based on a 'Best Buy' recommendation from Consumer Reports. Makes very hot coffee. Easy to operate. Nice looking unit. No plastic smell as others have stated. No problems with the carafe or leaking. Only complaint is the strong brew feature doesn't work. It's supposed to beep (3 times) at the end of the brewing cycle. In strong brew it beeps almost immediately and then shuts off. No issues when using the regular brew cycle. I contacted Mr. Coffee and they provided info for the nearest service center. I was told by my local service center it's an electronic problem. Turn around time is approx 7 weeks for a replacement unit. Has a one year warranty. Going to ride this unit out for the time being and see what happens.
Jay,5.0,"September 25, 2015","For the price, you cannot beat it. Includes water filter which is a plus. The best thing I like about this machine is the plastic smell goes away very quickly. Ran some vinegar through it on one cycle and it was pretty much gone. You can use a glass or stainless steel pot which is also a great feature. Mr. Coffee has a winner with this one!"
Scott  S,1.0,"September 8, 2014",After reading the reviews posted it seemed that this was a great coffee maker. I guess it might be if you like your coffee like water. The way that water is poured out from the spout into the ground coffee basket drills a hole in the center of the coffee grounds and leaves most of the coffee just moist not brewed. We tried adding more coffee and that did not change the brewing in the least. And if you think that the water filter that you put over the grounds or the brew strong button will help you are wrong. We are now looking for a new coffee maker
Ryan Lamborn,1.0,"June 11, 2016","Bought this after reading a lot of great reviews on it and have had it 3 months and it is now broken. Only used twice a week for three months, Now nothing on it works. Now all it does is make a high pitch noise that is barely audible and nothing lights up on the front or responds to buttons. The clock comes on but the time cannot be set. Never really made good coffee either, seemed to have a bitter taste. I had a black and decker $20 coffee maker before this that lasted over 6 years and was still going but I broke the carafe. This is junk!"
Blain Baird,4.0,"December 2, 2011","Bought this coffeemaker to replace a finially unrepairable Capresso.  Consumer Report rating was on the money.  It's a fine coffeemaker at a really fair price.  It suffers from only one minor fault shared by every coffeemaker We have used.  When you pour too fast, the pot spills coffee out both sides of the spout.  Only time will tell how durable it is but so far very happy with performance."
Blackhorse,3.0,"March 17, 2013","It makes good coffee, just like any other coffee maker; but it is hard to put the ground coffee in it's container with a big bump in the bottom of the container. Have to find some way of filling without placing the coffee container on a flat counter because it will tip. Difficult to get the basket in just right. Consumer Reports reported it the best; but I don't know why."
Roberta L,5.0,"November 26, 2014","I bought this for my husband when our 19-year-old basic Mr. Coffee machine finally died.  He loves it, especially the fact that he can program it the night before and not have to mess with making his coffee in the morning.  It's much smaller than the ever so popular single cup brewers, so it fits nicely on our short counter top too."
James Gerrior,2.0,"June 14, 2016","I have always bought Mr Coffee products and loved them.  First time disappointed.  Every time I remove carafe to pour a cup of coffee, it drips and and leaks on to the hot plate.  The old unit that it replaced was working fine, so I guess I should have kept the old one."
Bill Van Tine,5.0,"January 6, 2013",This is an outstanding coffee maker.  The controls are located on the top of the front.CON: the lid is hinged on the side and can limit the location of the coffee maker in the counter.  The past coffee makers that I have owned were hinged in the back and could be oriented in different positions.Overall the MR Coffee brand has been the best for me.  I use the coffee maker everyday.
TlPK,1.0,"November 13, 2015","After 2 months the clock fogged over, after 3 months it started making our coffee so hot (sporadically) that our coffee would taste burnt, right about that same time it started beeping for no particular reason and the chrome started to warp. 5 months after purchase it stopped working entirely. Prior to this purchase, I bought another mr. Coffee at Costco which also stopped working 2 months. I've always relied on the brand since the coffee maker I had before these last two was a Mr. Coffee and it lasted close to 7 years. Looks like it's time to find a new brand."
Robert F,2.0,"May 7, 2018","I really love the first one I bought about 6 years ago. So, I ordered a second one for my second residence. But, this one burnt out the second year after only 9 months of use (since I'm only there 6 mos out of the year). I replaced it with a different brand."
Amanda L Barber,5.0,"October 9, 2016",Automatic timer is great. Get coffee ready at night and its ready for you in the morning. Automatically shuts off after a little while too. Great feature for people like me who always forget to shut it off.
miriana,3.0,"December 19, 2016","Got this as a gift for my mom after her old one died, abs she loved it.  Said it looked so high tech, and worked just fine. Not even a year later, and the darn thing won't turn on.If you need something to get you through this will work, but I wouldn't choose it for long term."
Mountain Bob,3.0,"July 26, 2015","I was ready to give this a 5 but, now, with a family reunion in process, making coffee for everyone, I filled the machine with water and as it was getting ready to perk, is spilled water all over the counter. NO COFFEE! Upon further inspection, the return hose in the heating element cracked and broke and spilled the 12 cups of water all over the counter!I will call and register a complaint. I believe Mr. Coffee owes me a replacement!"
Dee,1.0,"June 20, 2013","I can't believe anyone is giving this machine a good rating. It is the worst coffee I've ever tasted, and I am no coffee snob! I don't ground my own beans, I don't need it a certain temperature...I just want to throw some Maxwell House in there and hit the button and guzzle coffee all day. I've just plugged in my old, leaking machine because I can't take another day of this terrible coffee. It leaves so much sediment in the bottom uugh. I've even tried doubling the filter, but it didn't help. I like my coffee on the weak side, and I have to add 3 heaping scoops of coffee and set it to strong brew just to be able to match my normal 2 scoops in my old machine. I am sending this back and ordering another Cuisinart, even though that thing started leaking water out of the bottom after just a couple of years and I'm finding they're notorious for that. I'll take the shorter life span over this nasty brew any day. Sorry, Mr. Coffee, but you blew it on this one. YUK!"
erin d,4.0,"September 29, 2015","The first one of these I received was not very well made. It wouldn't brew coffee at all. I returned it to AMAZON and got a replacement. The second unit felt more sturdy and actually works very well. It's difficult to say whether I recommend the product. I wouldn't recommend the first one I was sent, but I love the second one!"
Ricochet,1.0,"September 22, 2015","Gave this as a gift to a friend. He called me the next day to tell me how horrible it was.  Sadly there is nothing redeeming and no good reason to own this coffee maker.  Mr Coffee has taken many huge steps backwards with this unit.  Clock is no longer illuminated or back lit.  There is no hot plate temperature adjustment setting.  The water delivery system nozzle has to be moved in and out of place to brew and/or remove the basket.  The decanter is paper thin and extremely delicate.  The older Mr Coffee machine this unit was replacing is so much better.  It has all of the missing features mentioned above without the problems he experienced, headache or trouble.  Cost was about the same, but the lack of features makes this product a negative value worthy of no stars.  Nothing compelling about this machine.  We shipped it back the following day."
Sherri R.,5.0,"September 27, 2015","Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Chrome. I purchased two of these coffee pots to brew two different kinds of coffee each morning. Really sharp looking design and color.  We set the timers and have coffee ready and waiting on us when we get up. Great Product and Great Price!!"
JD,4.0,"November 25, 2015","It's an okay coffee maker.  I normally use an aero-press for my coffee so really anything else tastes below average.  Filter thingy is a joke, it barely sits correctly.  I threw it away after a week.If you use your coffee pot on a daily basis, I would maybe spend $30 more or so."
Alicia M. Byars,1.0,"November 29, 2016","Our last coffepot lasted 17 years.  This one lasted 17 months - and we only use it a few times a week, less in warm weather (and we live in the South).  So that would be about the same as the other one star reviewers whose pot broke after 4-8 months of use.  Just say no."
Worth Keeping,1.0,"October 20, 2015","The Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GTarrived with a front corner of the top cover badly warped and sticking up about an inch above the unit.  It would not lay flat,  After reading about the Mr. Coffee, we had high expectations and wish a little more quality would be used for this small part of the coffee maker.  The functions sounded like a lot to offer for the price, but the quality of unit became a concern upon inspection.  We did not attempt to use the coffee maker and returned it.  We ordered a Bunn Coffee maker and hope it will meet our expectations for a Bunn product."
Green,1.0,"April 23, 2016","Worked great then died after 6 months with no warning. It started beeping well before the pot was full in the couple of months before it died, so maybe that was a warning? If you check the Mr. Coffee website it's full of reviews of these dying after a couple of months."
AniT,4.0,"November 12, 2016","I bought this coffee maker a year and a half ago and it recently broke. I loved the delay brew settings and until it just stopped working, it was a reliable and easy to use machine. For the price, if you aren't looking for something to last you years, it's a good one."
Michele Allison,1.0,"July 1, 2016","I, too, purchased this coffee maker because of the Consumer Reports reviews.  I wasn't thrilled with the quality of the coffee that it brewed, but worse than that - it didn't even last a year!  My previous coffee maker was a Cuisinart, and I got it from a friend when she moved and I had it an additional 6 years!  So very disappointed in Mr. Coffee"
Oldman,2.0,"February 10, 2016",Made good coffee while it worked but it stopped working about 2 weeks shy of one year.
AB,2.0,"December 28, 2012","I bought this because it was a recommended product from a magazine but I have no clue why it was recommended.  It has a button to make the coffee stronger but I don't taste any difference in the coffee when I use it.  You have to swing the spigot over the coffee grinds before closing the top and I've never had a coffee pot that made you do that.  Also, the basket for the coffee is too small and I can't make a full pot of coffee because it doesn't hold enough grinds.  That's also in part because the spigot gets in the way of putting more grinds in the basket.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and wish I hadn't bought it."
Nick M.,5.0,"July 9, 2015",For the value here this machine is incredible.  Reviewed by the experts as one of the best coffee makers out there with regard to brewing a good strong tasty cup of coffee.  Got it on here for 25$!  I will buy again if needed of if the price goes down that low as a backup!
Missy,5.0,"September 9, 2016","Great Coffeemaker! Our old one would take forever to brew and finally gave out. We found the Mr. Coffee 12 cup on Amazon for a great price and we read the reviews and took a chance. It is awesome! Brews in minutes, Love the fact that it has water filters that makes the coffee taste great! We love it."
Rita,5.0,"August 11, 2015","So far, this coffee maker is working great. I have had it a few months. First, I had ordered a cheaper Mr Coffee ($20 ?), but was disappointed because the filter basket wasn't removable. That's a problem for cleaning  if you have spilled grounds to wash out. The programmable brew timer works well."
flaboater,5.0,"August 22, 2015","This machine makes a good cup of coffee. Yes, there was a plastic for the first pot or two but it went away. I bought the filters and it does seem to help the coffee taste better. I like the strong brewing option as I prefer a more robust cup of coffee. Overall I would recommend This coffee maker"
Jesse W.,2.0,"January 8, 2014","Well, for $30 of Chinese plastic I guess can't complain. But my goodness this is discount manufacturing at its finest/worst. No paper filters came with it, the ""water filter"" isnt held in by anything but gravity over the basket, a permament basket is extra, a thermal carafe is extra. Etc. And I love how its listed as ""Chrome"" when its just the color of the plastic front."
Christopher Alexander,4.0,"October 9, 2013","I'm not sure how much you can say about a coffee maker. This one works well and it does what it is supposed to. I bought it for the office and thus far, it works well and turns out a good pot of coffee.Do note that the power cord on this unit is short; maybe a little over a foot or so. If you have the coffee pot on a counter with an outlet directly behind it, you're ok. For me, the unit sits on a table and the outlet is close to the floor. The cord makes it to the outlet, but barely.Also, I don't have a sink where the coffee pot sits and it does require a bit of cleaning; especially, if like me, you use the metal, reusable filter than paper kind. Paper filters would actually make for less tedious clean-up, but I think I can handle this.So far, I don't have any complaints about this purchase. I don't use the timer, so I can't speak to that part of it. Even with the power off, the coffee stays relatively warm for about 3 to 4 hours."
Whatmarc,4.0,"October 30, 2013","Great easy to use coffeemaker was a Consumer Reports best buy.  Coffeemaker is good value and easy to use. The first several pots did have a plastic residue smell and taste but it did resolve.  I do wish I didn't have to pull the coffeemaker out from under the counter to lift the lid but that is minor.  I love that the basket and carafe just go right in the dishwasher without a fuss.All said and done, I'd buy again.  I like it more and more."
Eric,5.0,"March 1, 2017","My mothers coffee pot broke so I bought her this, shipping came quick, works perfectly. Had no problems with it when it came out the box or even making the first pot of coffee, she said ""the coffee taste so much better from this machine then the other we had"" so I'm glad!"
Ajjcea,3.0,"March 21, 2017","Well, she just died!  Lasted almost a year.  Compared to the cheap ones, lasted 6 months longer!  So not sure if that's a good thing or a bad!  Now need to decide if I buy another or just by a cheap one every six months!"
Chloe Powers,2.0,"September 2, 2014","Recommended brew temperature is 195=205 degrees to extract full flavor.  This was supposed to have done that, but didn't come close.  Also the water spurts out over a small part of the coffee, though eventually the basket does get all of the grounds wet. Would think a spray would be better.  If you're not too picky this may work for you.  I'm not a coffee snob but I know what I like and was disappointed, so I returned it."
Michael,2.0,"March 26, 2017","I ordered this October 3rd 2015. It has ceased functioning today, March 26th 2017. It was used daily and had a nice array of features. It is just too bad that it is destined for a landfill after only a year and a half of use."
Evelyn,1.0,"February 24, 2015","this is not a good machine, the steam floods the display and also escapes and could cause a burn"
wej,5.0,"March 5, 2015",This was my second one of these. Loved the first one so when it seemed to quit working I reordered it. When it arrived I cleaned it and ran a cycle of water. Before I threw away the old one I plugged it in one more time and it worked just fine. Don't have a clue what changed but I now have a spare coffee maker.
Joanne A,3.0,"February 11, 2016","I'm diappointed with this coffee maker for a couple of reasons.  I was unaware that you are supposed to use ""water filters"" (a pillow type pad with charcoal in it that gets inserted between the hot water stream and the coffee in the basket.  This slows down the brewing process since the water pools on top of the filter pillow.  If you omit the filter pillow the water hits the coffee and the coffee grounds bounce out (some landing in the coffee).  If there is to be a water ""filter"" it should be before the water goes up the tube that heats the water (which would help eliminate the minerals precipitating out of the water which ultimately slows down (and clogs) the tube.The first ""pillow filter"" that came with the machine only worked for about 2 weeks before the water started pooling so I just put the pillow filter frame in now and make the coffee without a filter.I would not buy this coffee maker again."
Lea,3.0,"July 19, 2014","Not very happy. I last had another brand, so it was on its last legs I decided to try this Mr Coffee. It had good ratings. But it is pretty slow, and I don't like the flat basket. The slanted kind seems to have more concentrated flavor.  Also it doesn't seem to get as hot as I like it. I'm keeping it until I find one I like better."
rtopping,4.0,"September 14, 2014","This is as advertised. The only slight drawback is that it does not brew dark roasts as deeply as a cone basket maker can. However, it is an excellent and easy to use coffee maker. I do recommend getting the thermal carafe. The glass carafe stays so hot it cooks the coffee and ruins the flavor if you leave it there too long."
Kindle Customer,4.0,"August 15, 2016","It definitely took a while for the plastic smell to go away, and the auto shut off feature doesn't work well at all (as in, coffee will spill/drip even though the carafe isn't in there.) The timing feature is good and works well. It really speeds up my morning routine to set it up the night before."
TJ,1.0,"September 13, 2016","I have had this coffee maker for two weeks and despite trying to brew coffee every day, I haven't only been able to brew two pots of coffee.  Not sure if the temperature gets too hot, but most of the water starts to evaporate before dropping into the filter. Even though I've had 12 cups of water (and vinegar thinking it needed to be cleaned), it will stop ""brewing"" (aka evaporating) after a couple cups. Not sure how I even managed to get any coffee made because the last four or five times I tried, it doesn't work. Do not buy this product unless you like throwing money down the drain or spending time returning items."
Robert A OMalley,1.0,"March 2, 2015","This is poorly designed. The fill lid swings to the left, so one cannot fill from that side, better designs would flip to the rear for access from either side. One can only see the water level on the right side. And they only provide a one foot power cord which is ridiculous. So when it is plugged in one cannot turn it to view the water level. I decided to round trip this ting within 2 minuted of opening the box. It is cheap dollar wise but I'm not willing to live with an inconvenient coffee maker for 5 years or so."
Kip,1.0,"June 10, 2015","I've had two of these. The first one lasted a couple years and stopped brewing. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and bought the same model again on April 10, 2015. It worked fine until June 8, 2015, when it only brewed half of the water.So, I used it exactly 53 days before it broke! I will NOT be buying any more Mr. Coffee products."
OIZUMI Munenori,2.0,"March 28, 2016","It's is working, but very slowly, noisily with lots of steam. I have to pour 1 extra cup of water to compensate the loss by steam, and stay away from the coffeemaker until it's finished. Only after a few weeks, the watch face got fogged by the steam and I cannot read it. I think I am buying a new one soon, and it won't be this model."
Steve D.,1.0,"August 22, 2015","""A great buy for the buck""  that was my original review.  That is until it quit working after only six months.  The ow price makes you forget that the quality of coffee it produces is mediocre at best.  But when it becomes landfill that soon.........Well it isn't worth any amount of money then."
WEL,3.0,"May 1, 2016","Ok coffee maker.  Every time the carafe is removed from the brewer, coffee drips onto the heating plate.  After about 3 months, the stain can't be removed and it begins to stain the bottom of glass carafe.  I've tried soapy water, CLR, and vinegar but nothing works for removing stains. Coffee is ok from maker, but it's starting to look ragged."
R. Rucker,4.0,"March 22, 2013",Unit recommended by Consumers Reports.  Makes great coffee.  Easy to set programmable feature.  Has regular and strong setting.  Works just fine.  This is the third Mr Coffee I have owned over the last 15 years.  This is a replacement for the Mr. Coffee I had for over 7 years until it just stopped working.  I expect this one will last as long.  Looks great as well.
M.K,3.0,"June 26, 2012","I've owned this coffee maker now about 3 months and it has done a decent job so far. At the most basic level, this unit does the job it is designed to to do well: Make hot coffee. It gets five stars for that. I've deducted 2 stars from the overall rating for several reasons that I will get to in the cons below.First the things that it does well:- Makes hot (not too hot) coffee- Has a strong brew option select- Brew timer for automatic brewing- Automatic shutoff after 2 hours- Has a thermal Carafe option (Haven't used this yet)- InexpensiveWhat I Dislike about the unit:- The Carafe Leaks! If you don't pour at the right angle when putting water into the machine, it will drip onto the counter. Not a huge deal but its such a simple thing, make a Carafe that pours well I have to take a star away.- The unit DOES have a ""plasticy"" smell. Yes I washed it through at least 5 cycles when I got it new with vinegar. The smell persisted. Not a deal breaker but I took a star away for this.- The Brew Selection option is not ""sticky."" My last Mr. Coffee machine would remember my option (I like the strong selection) but this unit must be selected with each brew cycle. Not a big deal I just a minor annoyance.- The coffee basket must be set just right or you will have coffee all over your counter. Again this is one of those things that you just have to remember to do correctly when putting the basket in. If it sticks up ever so slightly because its not in correctly, coffee overflow and spill out on the counter.Overall, I would recommend this unit as long as you keep the certain small caveats in mind. It's not a huge deal to me to have to wipe up a few drips on the counter from the Carafe leaking or to remember to put the coffee basket in correctly. For the price, this Coffee Maker does a good job of making a hot cup of Joe."
Jazzilady49,5.0,"April 25, 2015","After reading all the reviews on this coffee maker we decided to try it.  It performs well and is certainly affordable.  The front plate is shiny metal, not plastic so it cleans easily.  Makes great coffee too.  The only issue was a plastic odor but it is dissipating with time. This unit is also recommended in Consumer Reports!"
mfg275,5.0,"October 16, 2013","This is just great being a Prime member. This product is great, no hassle set up. I recommend you get the insulated pot for this keeps coffee hot all day, if you don't drink it all at first. The free shipping is great and you save money not driving around looking for a great price.Thank you Amazon Prime"
tapsynapsis,1.0,"March 12, 2016",Only buy this coffee maker if you are purchasing it for looks rather than functionality!  We have had this coffee maker for less than 5 months and already it doesn't work.  Do yourself a favor and look for a different one.
Samantha B Lane,1.0,"April 14, 2016",It's only been five months and it already broke. The heating element no longer works so it brews the coffee and is hot when it is first made but the hot plate no longer works and the coffee gets cold quick and does not reheat.
emme,2.0,"October 28, 2015","It worked great till today. I bought this brand in April of 2015, Its the end of October and it stopped working. Made 2 cups out of the 8. Lights are on, clock works but no coffee. Hope Hubby can fix it. If not I'll try another brand. Had high hopes for at least a year of use before it died. You get what you pay for. 4 stars when working, 2 stars for product reliability."
Lynn M McRobb,1.0,"July 28, 2016","Bought this as a gift.  Worked fine at first, none of the plastic smell others have mentioned.  Then it started just beeping intermittently, during a brew, during the middle of the night, etc. ... and it is a very loud beep.  Woke up the whole house.  Then, it just stopped working, period.  All the lights are on, power good, it just won't brew.  It is less than a year old.  I have a 12-year old Cuisinart that brews faster, hotter, and doesn't make obnoxious sounds in the middle of the night.  Will stick with the Cuisinart!!!!"
nofrillz,3.0,"August 12, 2014","This is just an okay machine.  One of the dumb little issues is that the clock portion of the dial is not lit.  I know that's dumb, but it's irritating in the morning when I go out to set it or at night.  Everything else works ok.  Just not the best coffee maker on the market.  Okay for the price though and as a back up."
Del G,2.0,"June 25, 2014","When I'm seriously tired, this coffee machine infuriates me. Because if I""m tired I forget how particular it is about how you line up the basket. Then I have a hot water  with coffee grounds mess all over my counter top and I have to figure out how to clean that when all I want to do is sit down and drink coffee . Then I use more 4 letter words. Aimed directly at the makers of this piece of crap. I am going to buy a replacement coffee machine and this one is not broken. I have never done that before. I usually just rough it and pray the inferior product just breaks.  But I hate this coffee maker so much. Its like some kind of evil torturing device for the really tired. I'll give it 2 stars instead of one only because it does actually make decent coffee if you line up the coffee basket properly.And to the person who found my original review of this unhelpful...I WAS TIRED WHEN I WROTE THAT!! forgive me!!"
Diane,4.0,"August 1, 2011","I ordered this coffeemaker on March 31, 2011.  I received the maker on approximately April 6, 2011.  I really liked it while it worked; however, it just quit working on August 1, 2011.  They just don't make coffeemakers that last any more - very frustrating!!IMPORTANT UPDATE FOR REVIEW:  I was able to get a replacement coffeemaker after taking the original one to an authorized dealer.  I later found out that I was getting electrical surges in my home, due to the location of my home being at the end of a circuit.  After having an electrician install a surge protector in the breaker box, I have had no more problems.  (Found this out when all my smoke alarms (12 of them) suddenly started malfunctioning!!)--- WAS NOT A BAD COFFEEMAKER, AFTER ALL!!"
Amazon Customer,1.0,"September 26, 2016","just got my hands on it....it stopped working during mid-brew, doesn't heat as well and never afterwards.... few hours later I retried and no hope, it just doesn't brew or anything...light indicators and digital hour are working but its main function is not working so doesn't matter...I demanded return of this item hoping it would get replaced with brand new one but it costs me almost 120$ in my country to send it back to Amazon...for a 26$ product..really?I learned my lesson to not buy a coffee maker from Mr. Coffee...I just burned 55$ in my wallet, thanks Amazon too."
Squirrel Girl,3.0,"March 27, 2016","I purchased this on 11/27/015. Exactly 4 months later it stopped working. The lights will come on, but it will not brew. I faithfully clean my pot every week, I even brewed a pot this morning. I contacted the service center, they told me to run vinegar through it. I told them I HAD cleaned it, so they told me to go to the nearest service center which is two hours away from me. Not worth the money."
J C,2.0,"January 13, 2016","Second coffeemaker with the same problem.  I read and followed all set up instructions.  When making coffee, the maker has a strong plastic smell.  When the coffee is made, the coffee has a strong burnt plastic smell/taste.  This is the second maker of this make and model the I purchased and both had the same issue."
P. Berry,5.0,"February 6, 2020",Perfect
PJ,1.0,"February 18, 2016",I purchased this coffee maker 2 & half months ago and today February 18th it quit working!  I was highly satisfied with it until today! Now I find out I can't return it or get a refund! Unfortunately I don't have the original package it came in and I would just like a refund or Amazon prime credit. My husband and I drink coffee daily so I'm going to have to get another one locally today. I will never buy this coffee maker again! I had my other one for 3 plus years. I just want some kind of credit.
Pamela,5.0,"November 17, 2013","Mr. Coffee does it again when they made this programmable coffee maker at an affordable price!  The only negative comment I would have is the timer bell, which alarms at the beginning and ending of the brew cycle during the programmable timer mode, a bit annoying at 5:30 in the morning and I haven't found a way to turn off the alarm."
michael,4.0,"February 4, 2013","I like it because it makes hot coffee, and it is pretty quick. Does what a coffee maker suppose to do, looks good. What I don't like is that the water filter is a little hard to get in position. It steams up alot in the inside and the top lid. I don't like all the condensation sitting or dripping down into the tank and sitting there until you make another pot. No biggy just my opinion."
Amazon Customer,5.0,"April 2, 2015","Very pleased so far with this coffee maker! The only con I could say about this is that I wish it had a feature to simply reheat a pot of coffee. Not a big fan of re-heating my coffee in the microwave. Other than that, I think it's a great coffee maker for the price! Seems to be made very well."
Steve S,5.0,"May 31, 2018","I'm surprised by the negative reviews. I've had mine for three years and have never had an issue with it. It makes good coffee and the delay brew feature is convenient as easy to set up. Couldn't have asked for more at this price.Still, one has to wonder, with all these other negative reviews, if Mr Coffee's quality control is inconsistent."
Christian Sweatt,4.0,"July 5, 2017","This coffee machine works just as a coffee machine should.  The only feature I do not like is the auto-off after two hours.  I use this in my office, and my co-workers often mention that their coffee is cold because the machine turned itself off too soon.  A nice feature would have been to allow the user to adjust the off-time.Otherwise, great product."
Elaine L McClellan,5.0,"May 30, 2014","Bought this as a birthday gift for my son-in-law in March.  He really liked it.  Used it once and when he went to use it again it acted like it wanted to come on but wouldn't.  Of course, the return period is up.  I e-mailed Amazon and am waiting for a response.Just e-mailed Amazon this morning and within a matter of a few hours they responded and are replacing the item and even expedited the shipping and it will arrive tomorrow!  Now that is service!"
Brixster,5.0,"April 6, 2014",This coffee maker lives up to its reputation. Very hot brewing improves the coffee flavor and the heating tray does a good job of keeping it hot. Easy to fill and sight glass for the water level is easy to read. Everything I hoped for in a coffee maker. I'm looking forward to getting the thermal carafe that is available.
Christopher M.,1.0,"February 3, 2018",This coffee pot lasted barely one year.  Think that is unacceptable.  We spend the summer months at another house using another coffee pot. So technically it lasted 9 months.  Don't buy.
Tom Haycraft,3.0,"April 12, 2013","Purchased same model before Christmas for our travel trailer, have enjoyed it.  Unhappy with high-end Kitchen Aid coffee maker at home, bought 2nd Mr. Coffee to replace it.  Works well, if this 2nd one didn't have such a heavy plastic smell that permeates the coffee, I would rate the product with 5 stars.  I washed components before using and ran a pot of water through it as instructed.  Five pots of coffee later, smell is less, but still noticeable.  I am now leaving lid open to keep it aired out and am using the water filter it came with.  In time, I hope smell will go away.  Strange that we didn't notice the same smell with the 1st one we purchased."
William M.,4.0,"April 1, 2018","Works as described.  Replacement for old Mr. Coffee, which had become a toxic waste area internally, even with frequent vinegar cleanings."
JP in OKC,5.0,"December 6, 2014",This is easy to use and makes great coffee.  The only con for me is that I have to put it on a countertop between two tall things and it's dark there so it takes some attention to pour the water in without spilling.  Also the clock is not easy to see (I'm 51 with bad eyes!)
anon,3.0,"September 15, 2014","Brews very slowly, makes a mediocre cup of coffee.  Pointless filter is supposed to be replaced every 30 days, but the part is difficult to track down--does not brew properly without it.Sadly, I think I got a good one.  This is just not a good coffee maker.  It will make a pot of coffee though, which is why it gets 3 stars.  It would have gotten 4 if the coffee was good."
Barry,4.0,"September 30, 2012","This brewing machine makes good coffee. While there are single cup brewers that make better, they have the drawback of having to always wait for that second cup. This model has a number of features that, while not absolutely necessary, add to the pleasure of making and drinking coffee. There are three additional things I like. First, it is compact, well set-up and not tall and clumsy like many other coffeemakers on the market. Second, one can order a thermal carafe with it which offers a wider range of brewing choices, Third, the results are consistent and the coffee is hot! This is no mean achievement. I recommend it,but I have one complaint: the shipping costs to where I live were more than the cost of the machine. Can something be done about this perhaps making the packaging lighter and more compact?"
Kris Meeks,5.0,"April 2, 2019",I have had no issues with this at all..  This coffee out lasted longer than my Keurig.
jiberjab,5.0,"November 30, 2014","Works great so far.  The delay start works well.  The basket for the grounds can be out of position before you get use to it so watch out as water will collect and the grounds will overflow but that was user error.  Just need to make sure it's seated in the right position.  So far, I am quite happy with this purchase."
GardeningGoddess,1.0,"September 18, 2015","every time this coffee maker is plugged in, it comes on.  and at other unusual times, even though the timer is not set.  a fire hazard--avoid it.  if you want to unplug it after EVERY use, it works fine."
JVV,1.0,"February 12, 2016","The worst product I have ever purchased. Thank You for having such a great return policy Amazon. This product is cheap, makes you buy special filters and does not work properly."
ShopTilDrop,4.0,"May 20, 2014","Pros:lots of settings (strong vs regular coffee)timerautomatic turn offbeep when coffee readybeeps when turning off pot automaticallyCons:If you don't get the coffee filter case in there exactly right then coffee will overflow and cause a huge mess!  This happened to me twice, so I always make sure everything is snapped in there tightly."
Jack Straw,4.0,"July 27, 2013","This is a very nice coffee maker, especially for the very reasonable price. We are replacing a similar 10 year old Mr Coffee maker. Good brand.Only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it sits on rubber bumper/feet.  if you are like us and store your coffee make on the counter under the upper cabinet you have to lift it up off the counter top to pull it out to fill, and then lift it up again to put it back under the counter. Minor detail, but cost it 1 star. I suppose I could take the bumpers off..."
Jim H.,3.0,"March 5, 2015",Good coffee maker at good price.  Our Cuisinart died after 8 years and we recently bought this Mr. Coffee.  The features measure up pretty well with our last one but for some reason the coffee doesn't taste quite to same.  It works like it's supposed to. If I had to do it again I'd pay the extra money for the Cuisinart.
roberto martinez,2.0,"December 16, 2015","Works well however mine buzzez sometimes. The original Mr. Coffee gets hotter than this one on high setting. The low setting is a waste i never use it. The programmable feature is cool however I wish the time was lit so I could see it at night or even low light, difficult if not impossible to see."
Haitham Salman,4.0,"January 28, 2015","The coffee that comes out of this thing is -water-. You have to hold the glass pot up so that it makes contact with the plastic drip nib. Left alone, this thing makes all kinds of noise, will spit out only a touch of coffee, and the top portion (where you put the beans in) will start to overflow because the glass pot makes no contact with the nib.Original Score: 2/5Update:A few more days of use and it has broken in. The coffee that comes out of this machine is serviceable. It no longer drops grounds into the pot."
B from Indiana,2.0,"December 14, 2013","I had to return first product as it kept shutting down before completing the brewing process.  Amazon processed the replacement quickly.  The second unit did the same issue, but only if I select strong brewing.  It's flawed but I'm keeping it.  Purchased based on Consumers Report ratin, but with my experience I would hesitate to recommend."
SSG,4.0,"December 5, 2017","We bought this coffee maker to have available for houseguests and we are very pleased with it. It's proven to be dependable and easy to clean. Most importantly, it makes good coffee."
Courtney Blackmon,5.0,"June 1, 2015","We bought this coffee pot for our 5th wheel travel trailer because we have the same product in our house. We always use distilled water to prevent hard water build up. We also found that purchasing a cheap ""permanent filter"" and then putting our paper filter in it prevents the filter from falling over from the high pressure spray and keeps the grounds from the coffee. This is a great coffee maker for the price."
DJ,3.0,"June 8, 2017",This coffee pot worked well for just over a year.  Just long enough for the warranty to expire.  The pump burned out.  Seems to me that Mr. Coffee coffee makers used to last years and years..  So so product.
B. Hines,5.0,"July 12, 2011","My coffee maker decided I was drinking to much coffee and decided to stop working.  I started reviewing a lot of coffee makers from many different manufacturers. For the money, this can not be beat.  I love it.  I do wish the thermal carafe would come with it and you didn't have to buy it separately.  But I am extremely happy with this coffee maker."
GAMCBETH,1.0,"December 29, 2014","The timer has failed again. The coffee pot shuts off every 40 seconds.  I have to push the start button again to get it to continue brewing. We complained of this happening with the first pot and Mr Coffee shipped us a replacement.  Now this one is doing the same thing, not even 6 months old.  We thought when the first pot timer failed it was a fluke, but now this replacement one has stopped working.  I have followed the cleaning process exactly as it it written in the instructions."
Smitty,3.0,"June 21, 2014",This unit makes great coffee and I love the idea if a replaceable charcoal filter. I only gave it 3 stars because after using it for a month the cheap plastic chrome in the sides became stained from the steam generated during the brewing process. Very unsightly and impossible to remove. Can't recommend this brewer.
M. A. Price,5.0,"October 21, 2019",Broke after a few months but the company quickly sent a replacement that has continued to work well with 2 or 3 uses each day.
Richard Zink,3.0,"June 25, 2016","Really liked this but it only lasted a yr. Never had a coffeepot/maker fail...Usually throw them out because they are just old.But ya never know, so I decided to get another one because....Like I said I liked it !!!"
Marc Strand,5.0,"March 1, 2016","First of all, I'm not a coffee drinker. I got this coffee maker for my wife after she dropped the pot from her old one and we finished sweeping up all the pieces. She did all the research for a new coffee maker and I paid the bill -- seems fair to me, especially since she is so happy with this one.It looks good sitting on the counter. She sets the timer, and when she gets up in the morning, the coffee has just finished brewing. It shuts itself off after a reasonable period. The coffee tastes good. In fact, the only complaint she has is that the coffee maker makes coffee even when the operator (her) loads the water and the coffee, but fails to insert the coffeepot the night before. Sounds like operator error to me, but hey, these things happen.She's so happy with it that I'm starting to wonder just how ""accidental"" her drop of the old coffeepot really was ... but I don't think I'm going to go there. I'm just glad she's enjoying her new coffee maker."
Denise White,5.0,"August 15, 2011","This is a well-designed automatic coffee maker at a great price.  I've seen others selling for hundreds -- and they're not ever half as good.  I purchased the permanent filter, still trying to get used to that.  Seems like I have to use more coffee to get the same taste.  Anyway, the pot itself is well made, easy to use, and is nicely designed.  Kudos to Mr. Coffee!"
Pk,4.0,"October 31, 2013","Coffee tastes better from this coffee maker.  The only thing I do not care about is that the lever inside has to be moved over the coffee filter to be sure the water filters through the coffee - small issue.  I do like the fact that in the instructions, it is stated how much coffee for each level - it is right on.The coffee maker was a recommendation in Consumer Reports and I am glad I ordered this Mr. Coffee."
Jeni Donovan,4.0,"August 2, 2015","The first time I used this, it perked and spilled all over.  I am guessing that the valve that opens the grounds basket was stuck on the closed position.  Make sure to check it before brewing your first pot.  Ever since then, it works just fine."
David B,5.0,"December 26, 2012",Bought this unit because consumer reports said it was a great unit for Money. They were right I made several pots of coffee the first day I used it and it was quick and easy to use. The decantor pours just fine. I have had units in past where you needed to pour over the sink and with this unit no spillage.Would definately recommend/
chuck,3.0,"October 5, 2013","I purchased this unit based on user reviews, price and styling.I have had the unit for a week and it works well and is of decent quality for the price.A nice feature is a short beep alarm when the coffee is done brewing.The reason for only 3 stars:The clock is not illuminated - so you cant see it unless you get right up to it.  So much for being able to check the time when walking thru the kitchen.The water fill opening is oddly shaped and kind of small - making it slightly difficult to aim the flow of water without spilling it around.the filter basket is deeply recessed in the unit and has deep grooves around it - making it hard to dump the scoops of coffee down into it without spilling some grounds into the grooves around the basket - which in turn will be hard to clean out.Finally, the control panel is over-designed.  My previous mr coffee with clock & delay start required only 2 buttons and two indicators.  this thing as 6 buttons and 5 indicators - yet doesnt really do anything more.  Its a coffee maker, anyone should be able to just look at it and easily make it work.  For example, what button do you press to start a batch of coffee???? how about ""Off/Select""  I am not saying this is a reason not to buy this unit.  Just kinda silly."
TR,1.0,"November 4, 2013","As stated in some of the other reviews, the strong brew strength ""feature"" doesn't work. If you select regular strength brewing, the light stays on the coffee brews completely and at the end of the brewing cycle it beeps and the light goes off. If you select the Strong setting the light comes on for about 30 seconds, beeps and the light goes out, and the coffee is poor, even if I pour the finished coffee back through the coffee grounds in the filter it still is NOT anywhere near the strength I want (and I have filled the basket 1/4"" from the top of the paper).I'm thinking this thing doesn't heat the water to the appropriate temp to brew properly.Will be looking for something that works correctly!!To all the reviewers that claim this is a great machine, I think that they must like to drink brown water, not good strong coffee"
Romeyd,5.0,"April 16, 2015",Absolutely perfect!  Easy to use to fill to clean. Coffee is delicious and I love the option to upgrade strength. Best coffee maker I've purchased in years. At this price I will happily replace in the year or so they usually last from my experience and be satisfied!  Great item.
Linda,5.0,"January 31, 2013",I needed a new coffee maker and I heard this one was exceptionally good.  I like the water filter feature in it.  It looks good on the counter and makes the coffee quickly.  The best part is the removeable coffee filter/coffee grounds holder.  It is so easy to clean and even has a light that notifies me when the machine needs cleaning.  I'm very pleased with it and have not noticed any drawbacks.
button,3.0,"September 26, 2016","This is an ok pot for basic use once in awhile. It is hard to clean, especially inside the glass carafe. If one wears gloves to wash, it can easily tear the gloves, as there is a sharp plastic piece inside the carafe."
Amazon Customer,4.0,"June 9, 2016","This is a great, basic coffee maker. The first one was bought about 4 years ago, which had no problems and hot coffee with very consistent use the whole time. This one was bought to replace it. Unfortunately the new one just stopped working after two months, but there is a 3 month warranty with Amazon and up to a year with Mr. Coffee so it's being replaced free of charge, and customer service was awesome. So I'm only taking off one star for the 6-8 business days I'm having to wait for the replacement, because otherwise it is a good deal for a decent product and warranty."
kbo,4.0,"June 2, 2015","I am not a huge fan of electric coffee makers, but still, I love this guy! This coffee pot actually cost less than my Chemex, and well, the coffee isn't as good, but it is convenient and programmable. When I want a really tasty cup of coffee I use the Chemex or french press, but when I am running around on busy mornings, this coffee pot is like magic!"
"Front Royal, VA",1.0,"January 29, 2021",Hard to rate when it doesn't work
J Hall,5.0,"February 2, 2014",I gave this 5 stars because it is easy to use.The coffee is very hot and stays hot. It shuts off after 2 hours.The only thing I don't like is that the gauge to show how much water you put in is on the side instead of the front. I just use the coffee pot to measure the water so it doesn't really matter.
Amazon Customer,5.0,"February 2, 2016","So far, so good! This coffee maker produces delicious coffee and keeps it hot a couple of hours. It's not a simple machine: you have to be sure the basket is in correctly, and that the little gadget which sprays water over the grounds is in the proper position before starting it. Also, there is a flat charcoal water filter that lies on top of the basket, and it has to be set evenly on top of the grounds. We use filtered water, but the extra water filter seems to make coffee taste even better. (Extra filters are inexpensive--you can get a dozen for under $10. They last through a dozen pots of coffee, and I think they are worth the extra money.) We have not used the programmable feature, but it looks simple enough. We prefer to get up and make our coffee rather than having a basket of coffee sitting around in the machine overnight and possibly losing some of its flavor. Hope this thing holds up, because so far, we love it, and the price was certainly right."
R. Comerford,5.0,"May 10, 2015","Great coffee maker. Have used Mr. Coffee for several years. Old one got dirty, I didn't do go job cleaning it. The new one is even better. The filter makes the coffee taste better (according to my wife). I was fortunate to buy it at half the price that Amazon is now showing. Great maker, you will love it!"
Ulrey99,5.0,"September 15, 2018",I live this coffee maker. Makes great coffee in no time. Extremely easy to use and take care of.
Lucy Rowe,5.0,"February 7, 2013","My old coffee pot leaked every time I made coffee. What a relief it is to have a new pot. i enjoy the automatic turn off after a so so amount of time, and the no leak feature when you want to get coffee when it hasn't finished brewing. It has a timer so you make fresh coffee before you wake up. Very nice. I would recommend it."
Don,5.0,"October 22, 2013",I never thought that I would write a review on a coffee maker. They're all the same right?  No.  This thing is so fast.  It has an alert chime to let you know when the coffee is finished. It also chimes when the pot is turning off automatically to see if you want the last cup.  Would buy again.
Amazon Customer,1.0,"June 20, 2016","We bought this coffee maker several months ago but just opened it about 2 months ago to start using it and it already quit working. The brewing slowed down about a month in and now it won't even turn on. Also, I am left handed and it is made for right handed people (when lid opens on top it swings to the left instead of towards the back). My husband and I are all around very unhappy with this coffee maker."
Jeff T.,5.0,"July 6, 2014",This maker is really super. Sets up nice for delay brew and has the stronger brew option. I don't know at what temp the brew is set at but the Folgers I put through always comes out just right. I had another insulated pot from older machine and it works well as a secondary backup for this model.
This guy,5.0,"September 27, 2015","When you clean it like you're supposed to theres no smell and it works great. Coffee is good, beeping when finished and when 2 hours is up is convenient. Clock is accurate and doesnt fall out of sync unlike last coffee maker. Would buy again and recommend"
Michael W.,1.0,"January 11, 2018","This is not the Thermal Option coffeemaker, although that is what is pictured.  I returned the first on, hoping they had sent the wrong item by mistake - but apparently that is not the case.  The Thermal Option version detects when Thermal Carafe is used and disables the heat plate,  Thermal Option version has indicator lights on the front panel showing Thermal or Glass Carafe (as shown on the ordering picture)."
mthuyer,1.0,"November 17, 2015","How sad!  I'm a deployed Soldier and wanted the ability for myself and the other Soldiers I live with to be able to brew some fresh coffee whenever we'd like to.  This arrived to me yesterday.  I plugged it in to a properly wired, protected, 120vac circuit and it started melting.  To answer any of your possible questions; yes our wiring is up to US code.  I waited 3 weeks for this coffee pot.  Oh well.  On to a different brand and seller."
S. Clark,5.0,"March 4, 2015","My daughter got one, then my other daughter got one ......well then I got it! Yup Its worth it it does make a good pot and the price was good.I will say I still liked my old Trusty Braun which they dont make anymore yet this does come close to it and at a third the price."
Sandi White,3.0,"November 30, 2012","I was very excited to purchase this coffee maker, as I didn't care for the one I was using.It is reliable, makes a decent cup of coffee.  The spout on the carafe is the problem.  It is curved too much.Every time I fill up the machine with water, using the carafe, it drips all over.  Easy to take apart and clean."
Joshua,5.0,"October 19, 2015",I dont drink coffee but i bought this for my wife for Xmas and she absolutely loves it! She loves the timer feature especially...having a cup of hot coffee ready first thing in the morning. And it keeps it nice and hot for a long time. I am so happy I picked this particular model. It was a hit!
Rachel Robbins,1.0,"August 26, 2012","I purchased the April 2011, which IS over a year ago-- BUT I think that any coffee maker should last  AT LEAST 2 years!!  I am ver disappointed.I was getting ready for a LONG workday (10am-9pm STRAIGHT-- no breaks), so I needed my coffee.  I was in the bathroom when I heard a LOUD shotgun-like sound that scared me to death almost.  I ran into the kitchen and coffee was all over the countertop, and falling down on the kitchen floor.  Was a mess to clean up.  I have no idea what happened!  I don't use the coffee-maker more than 3-6 times per week, and sometimes none or less-- So I have no idea why this happened.Also, there was a clock and coffee timer on the top, which is one of the reasons I purchases this, along with the ""5 STAR"" review-- BUT after a few months, the screen was all permanently fogged and not visible at all-- Even after a week of no coffee brewing at all!  :(I thought Mr. COFFEE was a good brand, but I guess not that great!"
J. M. Codina,2.0,"January 26, 2019","This unit did not seal well.  The clock became clouded with condensate from brew process.  Brew time, regardless of thorough cleaning became longer and longer.  Brew quantity went up in steam in greater and greater amounts."
J. S.,1.0,"October 14, 2015",Smells like plastic when brewing and it tastes like plastic. I poured $50 worth of fine imported German coffee down the drain because this stupid coffee maker made it taste like plastic. Worst coffee purchase ever.
Amazon Customer,5.0,"April 17, 2017","Glad I didn't listen to the user reviews. Read a lot of them that said it game off a rubbery type of odor from some sort of hose inside of it. I don't have that problem at all. Works like a charm, and is a great value for the price. Took nine days to show up, but that's what I get for going with free shipping 😂"
Daniel Van Eck,1.0,"September 16, 2015","Will contact customer support and update as necessary after.Seriously, it's become my part time job to contact customer support at companies to handle overcharging and broken products.Think you could make a product that isn't plastic fallible crap? Common'"
S A Stapleton,5.0,"October 3, 2015","Amazon, I love you!  My coffee pot quit on me suddenly, and I found my favorite brand on Amazon and only had to get by with tea for two full days.  It would have taken much longer going shopping for particular brand.  Makes wonderful coffee and fast!"
FL Chick,1.0,"August 13, 2017",I had this coffee maker just over 7 months and it quit working!!  I kept it clean and changed the water filter every month as recommended so I don't see how I could have contributed to it.  Bye-bye Mr. Coffee! Will never get another one.
GAnderson,2.0,"July 6, 2013",This coffee pot produced poor tasting coffee with a plastic odor and perhaps even taste. Awkward to fill and see amount of water on gauge. Had shiny chrome on front so did not fit in with stainless kitchen. Strong brew button refused to stay on. Returned to Amazon who gave great service on return with no questions asked.
Roxanne,5.0,"November 9, 2015","Perfect cup every time! Toast the Roast with my Isagenix Organic coffee and purified water! I thought I gave up on drinking coffee years ago, due to the toxins retail coffee has. Thanks to my companies new brew, I am loving coffee all over again!"
BrittanyAZ,5.0,"September 21, 2015","This is a great basic coffee maker.  It's easy to use and easy to clean, and it brews a great pot of coffee every time.  The only issue I had (grounds and water overflowing) was due to my user error.  I didn't have the basket seated correctly, and it overflowed."
Juan Gonzalez,5.0,"August 7, 2013","We have been using this coffee maker every day for months now.  It is simple and not over complicated, yet has some features which I really enjoy.  As most coffee makers, this one has a timer function to start brewing at a selected time.  What I really like about it is the ability to select a stronger brew in both normal and timer mode.What else can I say?  Its a coffee maker that works all the time, is easy to clean and I have never had a problem with it."
Kayla M.,3.0,"November 22, 2015",Nice coffee pot very stylishHad bought a second one for the office and its not heating well will have to return. Still like the coffee pot allot I think that one was a flukeStill really like the
SouthernHummingbird,3.0,"March 15, 2015","I bought this to replace a coffee pot that I have had for about 5 years, although its beautiful to look at it didnt work as well as my old one.  Since I really need one, plus this one received mostly rave reviews, I purchased this one. Complaint: The filter basket does NOT empty completey :(  Needless to say, I was disappointed in its performance."
JHawk,5.0,"September 27, 2012","LOVE this coffee pot plus it make darn good cup of coffee!  Easy to use & really like the delayed brewing feature.  Also, the price was great compared to so many of the popular brands of coffee makers.  Researched this in Consumers Reports & followed their lead in purchasing this item and I feel I made an excellent purchase."
Erin Weber,3.0,"March 2, 2019","I bought this in 2016, and now it broken - exactly 3 years later. This will last 3 years."
PC Sales & Service,5.0,"May 5, 2013","Makes a nice cup of coffee...doesn't 'burn' it but does keep it at nice hot temp.  Quick cycle is nice, too.  Has the 'sneak a cup' but I never use it because if you jump the gun you end up with too strong a cup...and then the rest ends up weak.  Just hold back the urge for 3 minutes and let the whole pot finish."
J. Bradbury,1.0,"February 3, 2016","We had this coffee maker for two weeks and it would not make coffee, we ran through all troubleshooting recommendation and still kaput.  So no coffee this morning, Mr Coffee answered my call and a new maker is on its way to my home."
Kristen P,1.0,"March 31, 2015","We ordered this item November 1st of 2014, as of this morning 3/31/2015 it is no longer working. 5 months is pretty pathetic for the $40 we paid for this. We only used it in the mornings to brew 8 cups of coffee & didn't even use it everyday. We put water in it this morning & it did Nothing. Extremely disappointed & of course by this time we can not return it for a replacement. Will not be using Mr. Coffee products again as we feel we have been ripped off."
Jeremy D. Benson,5.0,"January 7, 2015","Read other reviews about coffee spilling over.  Just make sure the coffee filter thing is touching the coffee pot, and no problems.  I also don't put more then 8 tea spoons of anything in the filter.  Normally I use 5 teaspoons of coffee, and three teaspoons of chocolate."
Adam,4.0,"August 26, 2015",My first one broke... The hose in the back split in half water went everywhere!  No coffee for two days everyone in my house was super pissy.  No bueno.  They replaced it though and we haven't had any problems yet.  4 out of 5 if it break again I'll write Mr. Coffee a letter for sure.
Anthony Yates,5.0,"February 14, 2015","I cleaned unit before started using to avoid all the complaints about tasting plastic, as you should by common sense with any coffee maker you purchase. The unit has performed above my expectations. The unit strong brew is very slow but I do not use anyway. The delay brew is confusing and takes awhile to get use too. The signal for finish brew and unit turning off is a very useful tool. Overall this unit is well built and I would recommend it."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"August 8, 2016","Coffee would run over the edge of the carafe when the lid was on while brewing instead of going into the carafe through the hole in the lid, sometimes it would just stop brewing before all the water was used/brewed - just never knew what to expect.  Hard to clean as well.  Tried 5 different times to use it and had an issue every time."
Reasonable Consumer,3.0,"January 17, 2014","While this coffee maker works perfectly well, it is most definitely not for the left handed user.  The top to the water well only opens to the left which means I am forced to play ambidextrous dexterity games every morning BEFORE COFFEE!  I don't understand why the top can not simply open to the back.  It is an outrage that Mr Coffee allowed this leftist design to make it into production!  Is the left handed portion of the population not deserving of the same convenience and consideration at the right handed?  Is the left hander forever expected to ""just make do"" in a right handed world?  I SAY NO!  Wake up Mr Coffee!  Get it right next time."
Damien,3.0,"December 20, 2016","Worked great... for 8 months.  But then it quit.Honestly, if this thing worked for 4 years, I would've given it 5 stars.  This coffeemaker really did make great coffee, loved the strong setting."
Joseph.,5.0,"January 21, 2014","Bought this machine to handle occasions when the single serve maker was just not enough. Prior experience with a well known 10 cup unit was a reliability/quality nightmare, so I gritted my teeth when I ordered this one. Pleasantly surprized by the great tasting coffee and the low price I paid."
John Lester,1.0,"November 14, 2013",As many others stated the Strong setting cycle does not work.  It runs for a few seconds then the three chimes sound and the light goes out.  Brewing does continue.  The manual states that the Strong cycle will stay on for future brews but this one returns to regular.  I called Mr. Coffee the woman told me to return it and stated that she had heard this complain before.  I would think that a program could be devised by the manufacture to test all the cycles and save these returns.  I liked the concept of this machine and had even bought the thermal container because my wife makes her coffee early and I make mine later and pour it into a thermal carafe.  Rather than try again we went back to the Cuisinart model we had before.
Tara B,3.0,"September 3, 2014","I have only used this once, but am surprised at how weak the coffee was.  I will try it on strong brew tomorrow, which will hopefully be better.  The Mr. Coffee that I owned previously didn't have this issue.  It brews quickly, which I'm guessing is why the coffee is weaker.  If you need strong coffee, you might want to look elsewhere."
sunnygrl96,4.0,"October 21, 2012",After reviewing other reviews and looking over consumer reports results we decided to give the Mr Coffee coffeemaker a try.  Overall we have been very pleased with the product. Very good value for the money. We were happy we didn't have to spend a fortune to get a good coffeemaker. I definitely recommend this product
ATLshopper,3.0,"October 2, 2015",Had to return this because I missed the part that the trim is chrome instead of stainless.  It's VERY shiny as chrome tends to be so the glare in a sunny kitchen would not be ideal.  Nice design otherwise.
cjaquilia,5.0,"December 19, 2016",my son loves this because he can set it and its ready when he wakes AND he gets to choose how strong you want the coffee which to a college student i'm thinking is 5 stars and then some LOL
ARS,2.0,"January 23, 2016",Bought it 2 years ago.Now water is leaking from the bottom!!The machine was barely moved from where it stands in these 2 years.I guess you get what you pay for.
Bernard C.,5.0,"January 23, 2013","This coffee maker is the best coffee maker I've ever owned. What a great product... Additionally, I did a review on the Consumer Reports website and found this maker is rated the best of coffee makers in the drip series.The delivery was excellent and arrived in excellent condition..."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"May 24, 2016","I purchased this Mr Coffee which made very good coffee but it quit working after about 3 months.  Amazon was great and offered to reship me another one or get a refund.  I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE REFUND.  I received the replacement, which worked fine initially, but now, again, it has quit working.  I thought I maybe had just gotten a lemon on the first try as I have the cheapest Mr. Coffee there is in our travel trailer and it has worked perfectly for years.  Not the case here.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you are willing to take a chance."
Bree Barrett,5.0,"March 2, 2014","i love absolutely EVERYTHING about this coffe machine. not only did it ship on time as expected, but its the best coffee maker ever. I love how you program it to brew in the morning and the best feature is the automatic shut off. The option to have regular or strong coffee is great too"
Christine F.,1.0,"October 21, 2015",This coffee maker actually worked good for 2 months and 2 days.  Then it would never turn on again.  We did everything in our power to restart it to no avail.  Very frustrating to wake up to no coffee.
Cbrog,1.0,"August 19, 2016","This coffee maker lasted less than 9 months.  It stopped working, mid pot, with no warning.  We had this at our weekend home, so it did not get daily use, only weekend and vacation usage. Coffee was never really hot, and the filter was useless. I would not recommend this coffee maker."
Mommyfit,1.0,"November 22, 2015",Lasted less than 6 months started having trouble a few months after purchase but made it work then it started smoking and quit all together. Very disappointed.
Cash,4.0,"August 27, 2015","Like the coffee maker just fine, makes good coffee also like the idea can use thermal if I want. However the the blue lights noting thermal  or glass decanter don't work or I am doing something wrong. Anyway it makes good coffee and I like it."
Andrew,5.0,"June 4, 2014","This is a very nice product, even for products more expensive, I think this is an outstanding choice in its price range, and those above it. I have had no issues at all with it. If this is in your consideration for purchasing, I definitely recommend buying it."
Ramona Holland,5.0,"April 18, 2015","I and my housemates have been using this coffeemaker for over a month now and we love it. No leaking, fast brewing, time delay works great. We use the ""strong"" setting and the coffee is super. Especially for the price this is an awesome machine."
Joy,5.0,"March 21, 2014","This is the basic coffee maker, easy to use, easy in cleaning.  It was a good buy.  It will be easier to replace thecarat also when it gets broken.  We couldn't find a generic replacement carat for our Gevalia coffee maker, and thereplacement from them was very expensive!"
Rebecca,5.0,"July 27, 2014",I love this coffee maker! We've had it for about a year now and it still works great! I love being able to set it up to brew the night before. The timer works perfectly and we have hot coffee waiting for us when we wake up! No issues with this product. Highly recommend it!
Kindle Customer,1.0,"April 20, 2016",The machine stopped working this morning after 6 months!!!!!!!  There are no words to describe this level of poor craftsmanship...
JN,3.0,"October 3, 2016","Its doing its job, not sure why, but doesn't nec wow me .  Had it about 4weeks now.Also the display is NOT backlit, so you do need to bend down to really look at it to set timers...etc"
JASman,2.0,"October 26, 2011","I bought this model because of a Consumer Report's recommendation. I have found that using it on a daily basis has made me regretful I bought it. You have to fiddle around down inside the pot to load the basket. Move the spout to the side and when you are finished getting your ground beans in the basket you place the water filter on top of that by hand. It is dark when I am making my first pot and looking down inside a black plastic chamber is a pain. They should have added a light, because i keep a small flashlight next to it now.I like strong coffee, so i got sucked in by the button you can push for a 'Strong' brew- Marketing strikes again. Does it work ? Yeah-- but you can better control that by the roast of your coffee and the amount of water you use.Why wouldn't they use a conical shaped basket ????? it makes a better cup of coffee in my experience. If you are going to make 12 cups be prepared that the sides of your paper filter will collapse. They must have realized that, because in the Instruction Manual they say to wet the sides of your filter. Huh ??? I have never done that with a conical filter. Obviously, if the side does come down, you get grounds in your coffee.I bought a Cooks 12 cup maker and it works very well. i often wonder if people like Consumer Reports make a pot of coffee and give it a review. As consumers, we are going to live it for awhile, and ease of operation becomes more important. It works but it's awkward to use."
Jerome L. Steinberg,5.0,"January 24, 2015","Love it. Had $100 Cuisinart that bit the dust. Did a little research and found this. Makes better coffee than the much more expensive Cuisinart. Only caveat, there is a plastic smell that lasts for about a week with daily use. The Cuisinart had the same problem."
Hans Andersen,1.0,"August 16, 2015","Mr. Coffee elected to use a plastic in this machine that emanates a petrochemical plastic miasma of such power that it overpowers recently ground, rich, French roast coffee.  I don't care whether a cleansing with vodka or vinegar and ample sun drying might correct the mistake.  For Mr. Coffee to release this on the market shows its contempt for the end user, and it deserves to go out of business immediately as a result of this cynical choice."
Vikki M.,5.0,"March 20, 2014",Great coffeemaker.  Have been using it for several months on and have had no problems at all.  Purchased the stainless steel double walled thermal pot for it and the coffee stays at the perfect temperature until the last drop.  Looks good on the counter and very easy to program.
LA,5.0,"August 5, 2014","I just got this and I really love it. It's easy to use, makes great coffee, and easy to program. Coffee is ready and waiting when you want it. The light display lets you know exactly what's going on. Brews really fast too. Excellent coffee maker for an excellent price."
wolwolery,3.0,"December 9, 2014","The machine makes very good coffee...  we tried the ""strong"" brew cycle once and decided the regular strength is just fine. However I wish the fill lines in the water reservoir were visible from both sides of the machine, not just one side. Depending on how your kitchen is laid out this could be very inconvenient. Also the cover doesn't close down squarely and I actually broke one of the hinges trying to flex the cover to get it to shut properly. And finally, I wish the clock was illuminated a little -- it is almost impossible to read in some light conditions."
J. Blackwood,1.0,"May 22, 2016",I should have heeded the negative reviews...product lasted less than 10 weeks before it stopped brewing.  What a waste of money!  Steer clear of this defective junk!  I went back to my 28-year-old B&D maker.
April Roffi,2.0,"January 21, 2013",I bought this as an alternative to a Bunn coffeemaker I've had for over 12 years thinking it got such good reviews that I would be happy with it.  But I found out how much I love my Bunn.  This coffeemaker might be fine for someone who wants to put up with the quirks that come with it such as having to aline the carafe and the coffemaker.  I had trouble with putting the carafe in just so the coffee would flow from the maker into the carafe.  It was always not in just the position so that it constantly backed up into the filter and overflowed the filter basket.  This then let the coffee grounds flow into the maker and made a mess.  I've since spent an additional amount of money and bought a newer copy of my old Bunn coffeemaker and wish I had never experienced this Mr. Coffee coffeemaker.
Jennifer,1.0,"May 13, 2017",Bought this Jan 2016. On May 12th 2017 it just stopped working. Made a pot in the morning and the coffee was cold. Disappointed in the life of the product.
Bob,4.0,"December 22, 2012","This is an excellent coffee maker. The delayed timer, coffee brewing, and all aspects of this Mr. Coffee are great. The reason for only 4 stars is the inability to keep the warming plate on for more than the 2 hour preset time. I think that a company sometimes forgets that we are smart enough to be able to turn the machine off when we are done with it. Other than that, great product."
M. Reed,5.0,"August 1, 2013","Love the filters and the taste of the coffee this maker produces.  I have extremely hard water, and even with filtered water there is still white granular residue left that these water filters to remove.  Nice.  It is speedy too, I start it and by the time I am back from picking up the newspaper down the driveway, it is about done when I come in."
Christine R. Moskowitz,5.0,"March 4, 2013","I've bought so many coffee makers in my day. Coffee and espresso, grinder built in, timers, on and on and on.  Yet, ever once in a while a Mr. Coffee was bought. No bells or whistles, just made coffee. I chose this maker because it matched my kitchen appliances, had a timer (if I ever wanted to use it) and it was a Mr. Coffee.  I tired of going through a coffee maker once every year. This coffee maker is great. Makes excellent coffee, easy to use. I use the glass pot not the thermal insulated pot. I've used those before and they can break just as easily as a glass pot. I am VERY HAPPY with this machine."
Heath Hysell,4.0,"December 11, 2011","Features are amazing on this coffee pot.  It's multifunctional in contrast to strong brew or regular brew, Thermos or coffee bot.  The lights are bright and tells you what feature is currently in use. The only down side to this coffee pot is moisture collects inside the time display section and for some reason the pot leaks."
Lacie Schwend,1.0,"February 15, 2016","Broke after  months of use. Started a pot of coffee, came to get some and it was like it just died. No power to it, cannot get it to register at all. No electrical function at all!  Hoping to get a refund or exchange from Amazon."
Mikey,4.0,"February 10, 2014","I purchased this coffee maker after my 3-year old Kenmore stopped working, and this model was very highly rated by a national consumer publication. I am very happy with it, as it brews a much better cup of coffee than any other coffee maker I have ever owned. The coffee is hot and tastes great, even using my regular ground Yuban. I would definitely recommend it, as it is a terrific value!"
Samuel Johnson,5.0,"January 6, 2013","Have only had it for 2 mos but so far so good.  Recommended by Consumer Reports.If you read a lot of coffee pot reviews--we searched for 18 mos--people say great coffee but impossible to clean, leaks, breaks in a few months. If I have to, I'd rather toss a $40 coffee maker that quickly fails than one costing $80-200 (been there already)."
D. Steele,4.0,"March 26, 2015","Product is good , however I think the water spout isn't long enough and doesn't saturate the grounds properly . Sometimes coffee farthest away from spout doesn't even get wet . I fix this by gently stirring coffee around in the filter while brewing , but this is obviously a flaw"
Kami Hardin,4.0,"December 15, 2011","This coffee pot works great...it's easy to program and has a water filtration disc. The only gripe that I have with it is that it collects condensation under the lid of the back section. If you don't want this to happen you have to leave the back section open after brewing to air out. Other than that it was well worth the money (or, since I paid for this with gift cards earned from swagbucks, it was worth the swagbucks)."
WesternCOriver,4.0,"September 23, 2013","Brews quickly, draw back: it quickly stops heating the coffee, and the filter system is awkward to loan and unload with a water spout that must be swung back into place each time lid is lifted. Filters are flat and I prefer a cone filter. Would not buy this model again for those reasons."
Shahab,5.0,"January 21, 2014",I loved this product.It is the best Coffeemaker I have ever had.I use at least 6 Coffeemaker as I remembered but this is the best.And Its very good because the price is nothing for this coffeemaker.If you really want a good coffeemaker I recommend to buy it.And the best point in my opinion its it you can give a program so you can make program to make your coffee before you wake up.Just buy it.My moms buy it for Christmas gift and this is best gift I think if you want to give to someone.
JBrode,3.0,"September 14, 2013","I had a much cheaper model before this from Target that I actually preferred. This machine is simple, easy-to-use, and it has an array of settings. While I haven't had any serious issues with it, there are a few annoying features. For example, whenever I pour water in it leaks through the filter and down onto the burner. It also holds a lot of moisture within it, which is new to me. Finally, there is an additional filter you can set over the grounds basket for water--it's a nice add-on in theory, and although it doesn't require a lot of effort, it doesn't fit securely over the basket and often falls into the grounds basket during prep."
jackie,5.0,"July 2, 2016","we make a minimum of 3 pots of coffee per day, some days we make as many as 5 . this should give you a perspective on the ratings we give . this mr coffee has been the best we have ever used . we used to buy a new cheaper model about every 2-3 months( mr  coffee) and finaly decided to try something different . i read other reviews here and went for this one . the smell that is talked about is real but it goes away very quickly with use. always follow the manufactures direction to get started. this helped to start to  get rid of the smell."
Nathan Z,5.0,"August 25, 2013","The exterior is made of plastic but the chrome finish actually looks pretty stylish. The delayed brew feature is very practical for busy workdays when you need to wake up, get dressed, grab a coffee and go. The coffeemaker can heat the bottom of the coffee pot to keep the coffee warm. Almost everything is perfect considering the price.The ONLY problem is that the power cord is too short! Gotta buy an extension cord for this."
retired guy,4.0,"March 24, 2015","We replaced our super expensive coffee maker after ten years with this much more reasonably priced Mr.Coffee model, and have been very happy since getting it. It was a top rated model from a well known consumer group, and we can understand why."

CK,2.0,"February 2, 2016",This is the second one of these that I have purchased because I love the features. The first quit working after about 3 years. The second only lasted 6 months of daily use. Coffee makers should last longer than that. Beware.

The replacement one began leaking water out of the bottom a little over 30 days after receiving it.  I am very disappointed in Mr Coffee makers - I've always had a Mr Coffee brand and they have lasted a good many years.  Going forward, however, I will not be buying the Mr Coffee brand of coffee makers."
Gigi,5.0,"February 20, 2014","After buying 3 other top brand coffee pots (all of which quit working), we decided to buy Mr. Coffee. We have been very pleased with the efficiency and how quickly it makes a pot of coffee. Love the alert beeps when the coffee is ready too. I highly recommend this product!"
Marci,5.0,"January 1, 2014",We have had the same coffeepot for the past few years. A few weeks ago-it broke. I searched Amazon and found the exact replacement for a great price. For some reason I was thinking it would be much more expensive - so I was thrilled at the great price I found it at. Great coffeepot.
ForkeyHorsey,5.0,"November 25, 2012","This is the best coffee maker I have ever had. It brews well, maybe a tad slow, but it is compact, attractive, and pours exceptionally well. However the the separate-purchase thermal carafe add-on is very poor. So get this coffee maker as long as you don't intend to add the thermal carafe later."
SierraRunner,5.0,"October 21, 2014","I love this coffee maker! I use this machine every single day and set it on the timer. This coffee machine is durable and produces coffee shop quality coffee. I really like the feature that adjusts your coffee strength, too. A very nice update to this newer machine."
Jessica,5.0,"July 13, 2016",I've been using this coffee pot for several months now and I'm very satisfied with it. It functions well and is easy to use. I love that I have coffee ready for me in the morning when I wake up.

Mother Ben,4.0,"August 20, 2015",Enjoy having drip in the morning. It keeps coffee nice and hot. Brews well no troubles there - would love a better way to manage the filter. If its not placed just right it lands in the grounds. Any suggestions wiuld be helpful.
pezgirl,1.0,"June 7, 2016","Worked okay for three months and now is splitting, smoking and clogging. I have to stand right by it and babysit. I hope every day I get at least one cup. I'm going to buy a ninja. Never again."
JD,5.0,"June 6, 2018","Would be perfect if if plate heated to hot quicker. Very good taste, 1-4 cup setting, carafe doesn’t drip, reasonable brew time, and loud enough ready alarm so can hear from a distance."
Tiny D,2.0,"March 1, 2014","I bought the pot so I could use the delay option and also have accurate time.  The clock runs fast so the delay doesn't work properly and the coffee is always turned on before it should be because of this malfunction. Also the clock display doesn't light up so you cannot see the time without a flashlight.  I sent back the first one because it did the same thing.  I had to pay $21.00 for shipping to return it.  I was sent another pot.  Amazon refunded $9.98 for the shipping and handling.  If I return the second pot, I will be out almost double what I paid in the first place for the malfunctioning pot.  Next time I will go to a real store where I don't have to pay extra if there is a problem."
HC,1.0,"July 16, 2016",It broke.I ended up buying the cheapest coffee maker I could find as these things are designed to almost be disposable.  It lasted much longer.
reservoir_64,1.0,"December 13, 2015","Lasted 5 months. Got up one morning, put coffee and water in, pressed ""on"" button, lights came on but would not brew and warmer stayed cold."
Kbilly,5.0,"February 18, 2015",It's a nice looking coffee maker. It makes hot coffee quickly and has some nice features such as strong brew and timer. It also is usable with a thermal decanter (not included); the setting where it doesn't use the hot plate. So far so good!
momdeplume,3.0,"December 10, 2011","This is a nice coffee maker.  I also purchased the thermal carafe which I like better than the glass carafe.This product makes a decent cup of coffee, but like another buyer, I, too find a 'plastic' taste which I can't seem to get rid of.  This affects the way the coffee tastes to me, therefore I am a little disappointed."
Lincoln Man,5.0,"May 8, 2014","Unit came on time, especially good since our old coffee maker with built in dispenser could only be used by manual pouring of coffee.This Mr. Coffee machine has all the options we need and worked correctly right out of the box. It is simple, produces great coffee every time and looks great on our counter."
James Anderson,3.0,"June 5, 2016",While the unit is affordable - it doesn't seem to produce coffee as hot as I would like. The coffee tastes pretty good - but went back to our percolator and Bodum as they taste better with our grinds.
JayIsOz,3.0,"June 3, 2014","Well the features work great, it looks pretty, but it is constantly making a clicking noise when the heating element is on and is pretty loud when it makes the coffee.  Not the quality I expected but it still makes me coffee so I can forgive it's obnoxiousness."
Joanna Lee,2.0,"May 11, 2016","Have had this for 9 months and it worked great, until it didn't work at all anymore.  As of this morning I am shopping for a new coffee maker.  I guess for the price I shouldn't have expected it to last forever, but I didn't even get one year out of it.  We used it everyday and didn't put hard water through it.  It just wouldn't brew this morning."
Sandie,5.0,"November 14, 2015",I was buying a new Bunn every year for 10 years. I decided I'd rather get a cheaper option so I tried this one.  I'm going on 2nd yr I run vinegar through it when it gets slower and there is no sign it'll quit any time soon. Makes  a good cup of coffee as well.
sbkramer,1.0,"August 1, 2014","I wanted to love this coffee pot and I did for the first few months. This morning after I made my coffee the whole house smelled of burnt plastic and the plastic on the outside of the water resevoir was so hot it felt melted. I tasted the coffee and it also tasted like plastic. I don't know what would suddenly make the temperature get so hot that it boils the water, but I now have to throw out a coffee pot I've had for 3 months. It's not safe to consume plastic people!! I would not recommend purchasing this product!"
Tim Giessler,1.0,"March 18, 2016",It worked great for 39 days ... on day 38 we noticed that it only brewed half of a pot and on day 39 it did not brew at all ... was surprised when I went onto Amazon to return it to find out that it is no longer returnable ... 30-day return policy?! ... now I can't find any mention of a warranty ... planning to call Mr. Coffee this morning ...
joshua d shaw,5.0,"April 17, 2014",THIS IS THE SECOND ONE IVE BOUGHT AND IM EVEN MORE IMPRESSED WITH THIS ONE. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A GREAT COFFEE POT WITH ALL THE FEATURES OF A TOP OF THE LINE PRODUCT THIS IS THE ONE AND THE PRICE IS VERY RESONABLE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS COFFEE MAKER TO ANYONE.
Amazon Customer,3.0,"October 24, 2015","Looks nice, works good, does have a harsh plastic odor. The coffee taste good. would have given it a 4 star if not for the odor. Only had a few days so hoping the odor goes away."
shattuck,5.0,"November 19, 2014","I bought this on the advice of Consumer Reports, and so far it has been good value for the money.  It feels more stable than most of the inexpensive coffee makers, and looks more expensive than it is.  It also makes good coffee and the programmable functions have (knock on wood) worked like a charm.  I recommend it highly."
Heidi Hollingsworth,5.0,"February 25, 2014","The wife is a paraplegic. The son is a social creature on the go who perfers flavored coffee. The husband will drink anything. This Mr Coffee system allows us tp brew a 8 cup carafe for the bedside AND a 12 cup pot of French Vanilla. Replacement filters, water filters, and carafes can be had online or at a local Walmart."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"July 30, 2016",I bought this coffeemaker in Dec 2015 and it stopped working in July. All the lights light up but no heat to make the coffee.I would have thought it would work longer than 7 months.
Jessica Erdely,4.0,"August 15, 2014","This is an awesome coffee maker. Great if you get up early for work and don't feel like priming the pot...you can the night before! Some other reviews say there is a smell that doesn't go away. I did notice the smell, but mine has faded the more I use the pot."
Mommyof3,4.0,"December 1, 2011","Makes great coffee.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because when pouring the coffee out of the carafe, you have to pour very slowly, or coffee spills all down the side (under the spout) of the pot.  So, I personally just have to wait a few more seconds (and pour slowly) before I get my first caffeine! :)"
Tom,1.0,"September 26, 2015","I bought one of these and it was OK - it lasted a couple years before it burned out.  I figured a couple years for that money was OK for all the use I got out of it.  So I bought it again, and this time it burned out in the very same fashion in just a few weeks."
LuckyMike,5.0,"December 29, 2013","Good coffee maker. We drink a lot of coffee in this house, and this coffee maker stands up to the stress every day. The auto programmable timer is awesome too. No more getting up and having to start the coffee. Its ready to go when Im walking out the door in a hurry"
Ready to travel,5.0,"January 28, 2014","Our son and his wife needed a coffee maker for us when we visit...they don't drink coffee...so I took them the old one a bought myself a new one!  It is very nice looking and works great.  Be sure to get the reusable filter, it works great too!"
alanmgunn,4.0,"May 19, 2015","Easy to use,, and makes a great cup of coffee. We have now have had this maker for a year and after using it to make hundreds of pots of coffee it still works great. It succeeds as a simple, inexpensive way to brew our daily coffee."
Mark,3.0,"July 27, 2015","Its quick.  I've found pulling out the carafe to fill a cup and putting it back whilst brewing can cause a leak.  Almost like the flow between brew and carafe are not aligned, so you get a puddle of coffee."
Ann Celine,2.0,"November 20, 2016",Worked great until this morning. Then it just didn't. Lasted only four months....Update--company is replacing at no charge. Five stars for them; still two for the product.
Sherman D. Wheeler,5.0,"April 1, 2013","I like this coffee maker because it makes good coffee and the carafe does not dribble all over the counter. While new, it does have a slight vinyl/plastic odor while it heats up, but that quickly goes away. Its controls are simple to operate requiring less than a masters degree to operate."
Randi Fuchs,1.0,"July 8, 2014",After using it only a couple of times it stopped working. Instead of pouring the water into the coffee pot the water came pouring out of the coffee maker base/ bottom onto my counter and floor. I am glad I did not get electrocuted.
Elane C,4.0,"August 17, 2013","I would give this coffee maker 5 stars, but it drips coffee if you pull the pot out too soon. That isn't a big problem though, you just need to be patient for another few minutes. Te first several times you make coffee, the smell of the plastic is quite strong, though it doesn't affect the taste. Overall, I love the performance and am very satisfied."
Pat,4.0,"December 8, 2014","Works fine except it needs more coffee and set to strong to brew as well as my old Mr Coffee. Took a few wasted pots to get it right. However, it does reheat faster. Reheated coffee is also nice and hot. I like the machine. It's basic and easy to use."
aliveinjoburg,5.0,"February 6, 2016","I had a bit of a coffee maker disaster when I moved into my new apartment and I definitely started out with a lemon from an older Mr. Coffee. I bought a Hamilton Beach hoping that it would solve the coffee issues and match the red decor in my kitchen but an accidental order turned out to be the best coffee maker for us. It makes delicious full-bodied coffee and quickly. Sometimes, I forget to set the coffee maker before bed but I can get up on time and set it as normal and I'll have coffee before I even finish getting dressed. I'm really impressed with this coffee maker so far and thrilled that this accidental order turned out to be perfect! Even after having it sit in the coffee maker for hours, I don't get that burnt or singed taste that other coffee makers get and there is no plastic scent. This one came with a water filter and I have extremely soft water here in Long Island so I don't use this often and plan on just cleaning it regularly with vinegar. All in all - this is a great start coffee maker if you're like me and like the idea of a full pot of coffee in the morning."
intimeagen,1.0,"June 15, 2016","Stopped brewing after five months.  Troubleshooting pages offered no help.  I researched the problem on-line and saw many complaints of same issue: brew light goes on and nothing happens, even though machine is plugged in, has adequate water, and the carafe and reservoir are properly placed.  Just cheap junk, in my opinion and experience.  Such a surprise for a household name.  Stay away!!!!"
Pam Baker,1.0,"September 21, 2016","I purchased this coffee maker March 20016 and as of today, September 2016 the coffee maker is broken. I can't even request for a replacement since Amazon does not allow me. The reasons says ""it's no longer eligible."" I purchased this coffee machine for $32 and now I regret it. Less than 6 months and it's broken."
cvvmax,3.0,"March 13, 2014","It's your ""normal"" Mr. Coffee Maker...nothing special...but it IS a 12 Cup model...Only thing is, I wished it came with the 12 Cup Thermal Decanter rather than the 12 Cup Glass one...and the only Thermal Decanter that is available as an option is a Model DRD95 (Coffeemaker Thermal Carafe, 8-Cup for BVMC-SJX33GT)..."
pamela sickles,5.0,"March 31, 2019",Its great
Joves,1.0,"May 22, 2016",Coffee maker is only 5-mos old and won't brew. Only ran distilled water thru it. Online reviews indicate that this product is fraught with problems. There is a 1-yr warranty but the help line is adept at the runaround and deflecting the blame.
Nat,2.0,"August 14, 2014",This coffee maker already broke.  It just makes a lot of noise but nothing happens.  I think something happened where the water just stopped filtering through.  Now I need to replace after coffee maker  after only 1 year and 4 months.  Grrrrr!!!
HM,1.0,"August 20, 2016",This just STOPPED working just shy of a year.  I've had cheap-o $8 versions from Walmart last longer.  I purchased this because of the delay timer feature.  WASTE OF MONEY.
Sara Lynne,2.0,"June 23, 2017","It was an okay coffee maker for a year and a few months, but then suddenly stopped working. Doesn't anyone make a coffee maker that will last forever anymore?"
Rhonda,5.0,"April 21, 2018",With the amount of coffee we drink. These are the only pots found to hold up. Love these..
Diane M. Young,5.0,"October 17, 2015","You need to buy this. So easy to operate and it does not leak!!!  Love the little shower head the water sprays over the coffee grounds and it does not steam up my cabinets.  Great coffee, too, in my opinion."
Bobbi,3.0,"February 29, 2016","Was disappointed the automatic timer didn't work when we got it and sense our old one didn't have a timer, we didn't really miss it.Just wasn't what was advertised. The coffee maker itself works well."
Regina Phalange,4.0,"February 9, 2015","I bought this as a gift for my husband. He likes it, and for the price I paid (cyber Monday deal), it is a good product. The machine will overflow if he doesn't place the filter basket in properly, but this problem can be avoided. We never noticed a plastic smell that other reviewers have complained about."
Ethan,5.0,"January 3, 2017","Arrived on time, and well packaged.The coffee maker has a great finish to it, and looks much more expensive than it cost. PERFECT GIFT for anyone, including yourself!"
Allen Intofairness,1.0,"September 23, 2016","Don't expect more than a year from Mr. Coffee.He offers no technical support.If you save your receipt and are in warranty, they say they'll replace the device."
Linda W. Astala,3.0,"May 19, 2015","This makes great coffee and the carafe from my now-defunct machine fits, which is nice.  However, as others have noted in their reviews, there is a peculiar smell, like electrical smoke, that refuses to go away with time."
Christopher,1.0,"January 11, 2017","Brewed coffee as advertised but for a limited time, I typically do not write reviews like this, however both the original received, and it's replacement, eventually failed. The first lasted less than 2 months, the second, less than a year. I guess that is what I get for buying a cheaper model."
Jumping Joe 27,1.0,"October 26, 2016","Do not buy this coffee maker! It worked great for a couple of weeks, and never again. All of a sudden it stopped pumping the water properly, so the whole house would fill up with steam and you'd be left with a few drops of coffee. Now it does nothing. The lights turn on and that's it. U fortunately it's too late to return it. Will not buy again. Purchase at your own risk."
D. Valentine,5.0,"March 6, 2017",I've had this coffee maker a long time now. It works great and produces a good cup of joe
JES100FISH,5.0,"January 5, 2014",My older Mr. Coffee stopped making hot coffee.  This makes hot coffee and it taste better; it was very noticeable.  It was rated well by Consumer Reports and they indicated that it brewed coffee consistently to 185 degrees; I have not measured it to verify.
Carl M,5.0,"June 25, 2014","Beautiful design, very reliable.  Makes excellent coffee.  We have been using this model for two years.  Old one was killed by an electrical surge.  We immediately bought a similar replacement.  Also bought a surge protector.  Highly recommended."
oRgaNic,5.0,"July 13, 2014","Mr. coffee knows their stuff. I like to look at the fancy brands and am more than willing to pay more if they are superior. I can never find a better coffee maker or more knowledgeable  company than this. I trust Mr. Coffee. Works perfectly, looks good."
N. M. Vorobey,1.0,"August 7, 2014","I purchased this coffee maker on February 2, 2014, and it quit without warning on August 20, 2014.  It didn't even last a year.  I purchased a new coffee maker from a different manufacturer.  I won't be inclined to buy another Mr. Coffee brand product - ever!"
britt,1.0,"February 17, 2017","Update i have had this coffee pot for 5 months, I make just 1 pot of coffee a day and it broke this morning! Dont waste your money on this model"
Sylvia62,5.0,"February 6, 2015",I love the counter footprint of this appliance. Get the strainer and filter to keep grounds out of your Java. We enjoy the beep of coffee being ready and one to remind you it's to get the last cup while it's still warm. Love it!
AJ,3.0,"June 4, 2016",Easy to use and easy to program for automatic morning coffee. The only problem I am having is that the filter occasionally overflows causing coffee to spill on the counter and grounds to end up in the pitcher.
sandonny,5.0,"March 10, 2018",No problems with this coffee maker and I love the control for the brew strength.
Kags,5.0,"June 25, 2016",I've had it for 2 years now. Great coffee maker. It's just like any other coffee maker with a timer. The strong and regular don't seem different too me. Maybe only slightly.
Gidget Girl,5.0,"September 12, 2014","This coffee maker is every bit as nice as the Cuisinart that I paid double for. When the BF and I broke up, I bought this one again for myself, as he got custody of the first one. I like the coffee maker much more than I like the ex BF..."
marketing maven,2.0,"June 23, 2016","Works well, but not for long.  Purchased one July 2015. stopped woking in October 2015.  Purchased a replacement...this one conked out June 2016.  Contacted Mr. Coffee customer support, still awaiting feedback"
j****p,5.0,"October 14, 2011","I have been drinking coffee for the last 20 years and this is the best coffee maker for the money. There are many great machines in the market; but this met all my requirements, and some: - basic programmability, simple knobs,switches, but simple to use. - uses regular paper filter, regular coffee(I use Starbucks or some Colombian coffee). - makes good coffee and remains hot for at least 2 hours. - no spilling, water overflow etc - Under $50.I wish the time window was bolder/brighter. You have to strain your eyes to see the time. However I can live with this, because I don't want too bright appliance lights in my kitchen."
Peggiann777,5.0,"January 17, 2015",So far this is a great coffeemaker. I love the water filter and the different coffee strengths you can choose from. My coffee tastes great. It arrived on time with no problems. All-in-all great purchase. I would buy this again and I do recommend.
kohpee,1.0,"April 24, 2016","Died after 5 months of light use. No warning or anything. Worked fine the day before and then the water stopped working and wouldn't heat up. The machine would turn on, you could set the time and mess with settings, but no coffee. $30 clock basically."
DEBS,5.0,"February 21, 2014","I have managed to buy coffeemakers right and left, only to have them dump water/coffee all over my kitchen counter 'cause I didn't get something positioned ""just so.""  Mr. Coffee to the rescue!  It's so easy to use that even I can't screw it up!"
Rachel Skybetter,2.0,"November 18, 2015","DO NOT BUY THIS. I bought this because it was recommended on Consumer Reports, and now less than nine months later the pump has failed and it isn't sucking up enough water to fill the pot. And of course, it's not replaceable at this point. So disappointed. It worked fine before then but it shouldn't just break out of nowhere. It's ludicrous to have to buy two coffee makers in one year."
DK,3.0,"January 27, 2016","This coffee maker is alright.It brews your coffee, keeps it hot, goes off after 2 hours, and even has a set brew time feature. I havent had the issue some have claimed to have with the steam getting into the digital clock area but I absolutely can taste the plastic when it doesnt have the filter attached. I have been using this maker for a little bit now and havent used it without the filter yet so I can say that it is something that wears off with time or not. The feature where it states it brews regular or stronger coffee, I dont see any difference in the strength of the coffee so I dont use that feature anymore. The pot seems to somehow only fill up partially. What I mean is I fill up to the 6 maybe a little more, brew my coffee, and I only have it brewed half between the 4 and 6. Im assuming this is because of it steaming away. You get used to it and just add more water and youre good to go."
Technomed,4.0,"May 18, 2014","This economically priced coffee maker makes great coffee. Like others, I agree that it has a bit of a plastic scent when used at first. However, two brew cycles of vinegar/water solution (approx. 2 oz. vinegar per 12-cup water fill-ups) fixed it."
E. L. Blakey,1.0,"January 28, 2015",I just bought this pot several months ago and this morning it simply stopped  working.  I can't believe it.  I thought Mr. Coffee products were supposed to be one of the best and most reliable.  What  piece of junk.. Do  not buy this product.
Robert J. Donnelly,4.0,"March 27, 2014",An attractive standard coffee maker for folks who just want a cup of coffee and not 400 other features. Reasonable price and tasty coffee with no drip quick access to an individual cup while its still brewing.
Paisley W.,5.0,"September 21, 2016",We ordered this for my grandmother after the keurig we purchased her was too complicated. It's great and works exactly as it should. It's also asethetically pleasing.
Peter S.,4.0,"December 26, 2016",Have had the coffee maker for over a year and zero issues. Wife would like if the coffee was hotter but I am more than happy with it. Only negative is the clock does not light up. Minor inconvenience in my opinion.
cad,5.0,"April 2, 2014",This things works great. I never got that plastic taste that some folks spoke of. I'm very happy with it. My only complaint is that you can barely see the clock. It does not have a bright read out like some models do. Certainly not a deal breaker.
Silvercrown,5.0,"February 23, 2014",We love the coffeemaker.  We program it for the a.m. and coffee is ready when we wake up.  It's easy to use.  The only con we have is that the coffee is not hot enough.  30 seconds in the microwave fixes that issue with no problem.  We recommend it.
B.T.,1.0,"January 20, 2016","Bought this in August, stopped working this morning. Like others mentioned, it simply stopped brewing. Mr Coffee suggests taking it to an ""authorized service center"" for repair or replacement. There are none in my state. Since I don't feel like a roadtrip for a 30 dollar coffeemaker, I guess I'll just never buy another Mr. Coffee again. Buyer beware!"
Shellie Vandergrift,5.0,"July 8, 2014","This coffee maker is the best seller for a reason. It has several ways that you can brew your coffee, as well as it tells you when it is done brewing by beeping, and beeps after the two hours is up to let you know that it is shutting off."
donald,3.0,"April 18, 2015",THIS COFFEE MAKER MAKES GREAT COFFEE BUT SHOULD NOT BE MADE IN BLACK...... IT SHOULD BE WHITE.  THE CHAMBER WHERE THE POT SITS IS SO DARK THAT ONE CANNOT SEE HOW MUCH COFFEE IS AVAILABLE IN THE POT.  OUR OLD WHITE UNIT OF 20 YEARS IS BEING MISSED..........

NO COFFEE... it didn't work, it wouldn't even turn on; I didn't have the box so I trashed it!! The Mr. Coffee company should have it right by now -- they should never have a Coffeemaker that dosen't work they've been in business long enought to GET IT RIGHT!!"

Z,5.0,"April 1, 2014","Had a variey of coffee makers some on the high end with different life span, but this one seems to be keeping pace with the best so far.  Am pleased and makes the right temp and strength.  Nice controls too. Coffee maker has improved their game with this model."
dane weaver,2.0,"December 22, 2015",I loved the coffee pot when it was working. Within two months it burned out. I expected great things but ultimately this Mr Coffee brewing system left me decaffeinated.
Vanessa,5.0,"April 15, 2015","It worked really well for 2 months but then broke. Last night I was rinsing the pot and the entire side of the pot broke, glass everywhere. I did not hit it, bump it etc. I replaced the decanter and it just didn't work."
Ashleigh,5.0,"October 28, 2014","I just received this today, after reading many reviews of tons of different coffee makers.  I tend to be a bit of a coffee snob, so the cheap price on this one made me wary.  I brewed my first pot of coffee and it is delicious.  I love the pour and pause feature, the thermal carafe, and especially the timer so that coffee can be ready when I wake up.  I have been using a Keurig for the past 3 years and I am tired of paying so much for K-cups.  I like being able to refill my coffee! Love it so far - will update after I have been using for a while."
MADYMUSIC,5.0,"August 29, 2015","My last Mr. Coffee died, and I only buy Mr. Coffees! (Could Joe DiMaggio ever be wrong??) This new machine, while having controls in different places than the old, looks very well and the timer is quite useful. Recommended."
CALMLILAC,5.0,"November 4, 2013","I love my Mr coffee.  I read the reviews for other coffee makes, more expensive ones but found myself back to this one.  I had a Mr Coffee maker years ago and forgot how good a cup of coffee it makes. I am happy I bought this machine and saved money too."
Theresa Liford,3.0,"June 17, 2016",The coffee maker leaks all over when you try to fill a cup in the middle of brewing.  It is easy to use and starts right on time.  I don't like the little water filter that comes with it.  It won't stay in place and wears out easily.  The filter comes away from its frame after only a few uses.
MBucksss,1.0,"March 30, 2018","Had it for less than 3 years and already stopped working. All the lights turn on, but it doesn’t brew. I popped the bottom open and but couldn’t get the tubes off. Don’t waste your money"

Steven Eggert,2.0,"November 17, 2016",Poor quality. My wife now regrets giving up our 1979 Sears coffee maker. It was getting slow. Pieces come apart and fall off on this one but never the Sears model.
Lilly,1.0,"July 28, 2016",I don't know how long a coffee make is supposed to last but this one lasted one year.  I had to pull my old mr coffee out that I've had for a good ten years!  Maybe I just got a dud but I'm sure not happy about it!
C. P. Palatine,5.0,"September 4, 2014",The unit works great . I purchased it to replace a 10 year old Mr Coffee coffeemaker that stopped brewing.The item was purchased  through Amazon prime an arrived the very next day. A+ for the item and super fast delivery.
taarheel,3.0,"December 16, 2016",Bought this about 17 months ago (on Amazon).  It died yesterday.  Coffee was just OK.  Usually not hot enough.  Probably the shortest lived coffee maker I have ever owned.  Will not be buying another one.

R. Hawkins,4.0,"March 12, 2014","Oh sure everybody else on the planet is buying the latest greatest new coffee machines.  I just wanted a reliable coffee maker that would not cost ""an arm and a leg"" every time I wanted a cup of coffee.  Mr. Coffee has not let me down."
Jim N.,3.0,"August 15, 2014","Although it was highly rated by Consumer Report, it felt just okay.  The coffee didn't brew at the high temperature as I like.  I also agree with some of the reviewers, it did have the plastic taste at the beginning, then it went away after few weeks of usage or maybe I got used to it.  You can reduce the plastic taste by brewing the coffee with the top open."
John,1.0,"March 22, 2016","I bought it on 01 October 2015.  Today is 22 March 2016.  It is now broken.  Previously, the valve would clog or the carafe wouldn't sit right and everything would spill.  Just save your money and buy something else."
Sablelulu,4.0,"March 17, 2014",finally a coffee maker .. i love .. wish it stayed on longer but only thing i can find wrong . then i made it so . this even has a water filter you put on inside on coffee holder . love that just grateful to have water ..right ?/
fujiyamama,2.0,"September 11, 2016",This was a great maker for the price. It stopped working in 4 months.
Diana Hull,2.0,"October 27, 2015","i loooooooved this coffeemaker it made my coffee deliciously every morning until today when it just stopped I bought it in June. Five months is not long enough, why did it have to leave me like this. Ok but seriously it wont do anything it turns on and nothing happens. I'm very disappointed."
JKC,2.0,"May 16, 2016","At first, we were very excited about this coffeemaker.  It kept the coffee hot, tasted great, was quiet, looked good.  Then a day after we are no longer able to return it,  we noticed that water condensation was in the window of where the time should be displayed.  This morning it shut off shortly after finishing brewing, when typically it is a couple hours after brewing.  Very disappointed because our last Mr. Coffee maker lasted us over ten years."
Psychprofessor,4.0,"August 17, 2013","I got this product, followed the instructions, and it works perfectly, About the only problem I've found with it is that I'm left-handed, and you put the water in in a way that's better for a right-handed person. If you're right handed, you'll love it."
Karen Kim,1.0,"January 13, 2016",If I could return this for free I would.  It smells like plastic still after over a dozen runs through it.  The coffee tastes bad and not fresh even when freshly brewed.
Kindle Customer,1.0,"January 13, 2016",Broke after having a couple months. Bought the thermal one and it did the same thing. Stay away from mr.coffee!
Jagpilot,4.0,"October 1, 2015",Make sure you put the black plastic basket back in and seated properly or you will get coffee and grounds all over the counter. Otherwise a nice compact unit where countertop real estate is prime.
Amazon Customer,5.0,"October 27, 2015",Very highly rated from many consumer magazines. Never had a hiccup after a couple years of use. Makes a great cup of coffee and much better than many more expensive models. Gets the job done.
dande2169,1.0,"April 23, 2016","First, let me tell you that I am a coffee snob. I like coffee that is medium to bold roast - the stronger the better, but it can not be bitter (I do not buy Starbucks because their ""quality"" is nothing compared to what I am willing to consume). I buy high quality coffee beans and grind them as needed. I've never had a bad cup of coffee with my beans regardless of using a programmable coffee maker or a french press, until I used this coffee maker.The coffee maker we had been using for years needed to be replaced and because of my preferences, I opted for this coffee maker at a local retailer since it has an option to select brew strength. What a joke. I'm extremely disappointed in this coffee maker and it's inability to brew a good cup of coffee. Regardless of how many grounds I put into the basket and the fact that I set it to brew strong coffee, the coffee maker brewed weak coffee - equivalent to watered down convenience store coffee. Every pot of coffee ended up with coffee grinds in it, even when I only filled the basket 1/4 of the way.Now, for the price, I wasn't expecting the coffee maker to perform like more expensive ones. But I also was not expecting such poor quality brewing.I have since purchased a different brand coffee maker and my coffee is just as good as I expect it to be. I do not recommend this coffee maker for anyone who wants a quality cup of coffee."
eyeguy,2.0,"March 18, 2015",Had this coffee maker just a few months and the coating is already flaking off of the warming plate. Don't understand why it's rated so high or recognized as one of the best products of 2011 . It's average at best. Don't recommend and won't buy again.
Elmer E. Smith,1.0,"October 23, 2019","Coffee maker only lasted four months!! Stopped working, light on, but not brewing even after cleaning with vinegar. This is the second Mr. Coffee pot that has gone bad for us. Will not buy another Mr Coffee."
Kindle Customer,2.0,"August 5, 2015","Ive been using Mr. Coffee for years without ANY problem! But lo and behold:  on the 33rd day of ownership, this unit failed!  Three days after Amazon's allowable return period!  Ive never had a problem with ANY Amazon product until now.I replaced the unit from a local retailer and will deposit this in the trash."
CarolinaSouthern,5.0,"November 13, 2012",Had an old Mr. Coffee from long ago.  Replaced it with this new one & I am so glad that I did.  This Mr. Coffee keeps the coffee much hotter than my old one.  You do need to pour your water in BEFORE putting the grounds in or you may end up splashing grounds out into the coffeepot itself.  The only thing that would make this coffemaker better would be a backlight on the clock because basically it's pointless as it is unless you are standing right in front of the coffeemaker!  Still a good purchase...coffee is great & it stays hot just using the glass canister that comes with it.
Dawnn,5.0,"July 16, 2013",It was better then I thought I love it it has a filter for the water and you can buy a thermal pot I will buy one I recommend it because the regular pot seems a bit on the light side and the thermal pot sold separately will keep coffee hot for several hours.
Mark E Blackwood,1.0,"February 16, 2014","I made the mistake of buying in spite of several reviews warning me not to. Consumer Reports had touted it as a really good coffeemaker. It is for my lake house so I do not use it everyday. First time I used it it worked fine. Second day I noticed it shut itself off before it finished brewing. I just turned it back on and it finished brewing fine. Then yesterday (three weeks later) I am finally using it again and it keeps shutting itself off again and again and again. I had to stand there and turn it on about 40 times to get my pot of coffee. So I box it up and bring it home, get on Amazon and find out my 30 day window to return expires three days ago. I am PISSED. I am pissed that Mr. Coffee makes a piece of crap in spite of tons of feedback about how the product malfunctions. I am pissed at Amazon's return policy. And I am pissed that I was stupid enough not to listen to the dozens of reviewers who warned me about the problems. I also have a nice thermal karafe that is designed to fit a coffemaker that is going in the trash. Nice."
Elizabeth Benzinger,2.0,"June 4, 2014","Sometimes some of the coffee grounds are still dry once the brewing cycle is finished. This especially happens not the ""strong"" setting. Also, some coffee splashed on the metal trim and for some reason it is permanently stained where the coffee was."
Scott,1.0,"October 13, 2013","This thing stopped working after 1 week (and conveniently after I threw out the packaging). The problem was the heating element would heat the water until it turned to steam. The only route for the steam to escape was out from the bottom of the filter basket and in front of the electronic controls. For those of you who don't know, steam+electronics=failure. It's possible the machine was so embarrassed about the horrible tasting coffee it brewed that it decided to take the honorable way out and kill itself. Either way, it has since been buried."
Anne Johnson,3.0,"August 3, 2013","I do not like the round filters ..( cones are more efficient);, the mechanism to remove filter is awkward--the sprayer gets in the way.  Also your directions make very weak coffee--I used twice as much, & still must select ""strong"" strength."

HollyWK,1.0,"May 7, 2016","My husband drinks coffee on the weekends and I do not drink it at all.  We purchased this coffee maker last July and it has worked intermittently for the last 60 days, finally giving up the ghost this morning.  I guess at $35 we got our money's worth out of it, but when you add in everything we bought to go with it, it was not worth the price.  And for you lefties out there, my husband says it is a pain in the rear to fill it as it opens to the left side.  I suggested simply turning it sideways, but apparently this takes too much effort.  It is going in the garbage as we no longer have the box to return it in.  For the record, the Cuisinart we replaced with it lasted 9 years."
stormy Daze,5.0,"April 13, 2015",I love this coffee maker I have ordered three and plan to order two more for our vacation homes that we rent out in the mountains. Wonderful features little cost can't beat that. Highly rated by the reviews
Douglas Taylor,5.0,"November 21, 2015","It is an excellent coffee pot.  However, because of the fact that my water ruined my last coffee pot I was looking for a coffee pot that would filter the water before entering the innards of the coffee pot.  This filter is a gimmick.  It sits on top of the coffee grounds and supposedly removes the chlorine taste from the water.  The coffee gets very hot very quickly and the timer function works very well.  Just do not buy it for the gimmick reason and you will be very satisfied."
John,5.0,"May 29, 2013","This makes great coffee and I do not even use the filter for the water. I bought the metal filter, but still use the paper filters as the taste is better to me. I bought it used and am happy withit. I will continue to look for great used deals from Amazon."
Robert Johnson,2.0,"August 18, 2016",Most Coffee pots last more than one year..  08-18-2016  stopped working completely.  stopped perculating and the didn't heat up the small amount it did do.
Katie,5.0,"March 13, 2013","Easy to set up for delayed brew, and it's obvious by looking at it that I remembered to set it up for the next day.  Just make sure the filter is settled fully into the machine before you press ""start"" - otherwise you have a messy, messy mess on your hands."
Deanna,4.0,"March 10, 2015","Great coffee maker. Sturdy and quick. Option for stronger coffee is great. Missing one star because the ""filter"" just kinds sits on the coffee basket. Has to be moved and put back every time coffee is made."
Kindle Customer,1.0,"May 4, 2015","Defective item:  worked two days, then the dial steamed up inside, machine  pumped 4 out of 8 cups on the next two tries, and then quit completely and now  won't even light up. Might be a good coffee maker ... if it made coffee!"
klsyking,5.0,"November 3, 2014","this has been way better than I expected.  I was ready to spend over 100$ on a coffee maker, but my husband talked me in to this one instead.  I am very happy with it.  The coffee is great and it's very easy to program."

We will see what happens.  Cannot recommend this appliance!  Suggest try other brands."
HAZEL S.,5.0,"July 7, 2015",Have to say we have had this for some time and it still works.  That's a HUGE plus as most replacement coffee makers we have purchased at much higher prices never last longer than a year.  I use it several times daily.  I'd highly recommend this model.
RudysMom,5.0,"January 16, 2014",Got this just for my large volume coffee drinking company.  It is stored otherwise so appreciate the cord storage space.  Coffee taste great from this coffeemaker.  Programming was easy to use.  Works fast so coffee is available quickly.
John Galt,1.0,"March 20, 2014",This coffee maker is easy to use but who cares when the coffee is terrible and it doesn't work half the time.  We had this less than 30 days and it will not make coffee.  the water won't pass through.Hate it.  and there is no way to return it.
bücherwurmregensburg,5.0,"January 22, 2014",I was tired of using our capsule coffeemaker and buying the superexpensive capsules.So i got the Mr. Coffee Coffeemaker and it works great. We use it with the GTF2-1 Basket Style Permanent Filter.We are very pleased with both of them!
Sharon I.,1.0,"June 30, 2016","I bought this coffee maker after my last Mr Coffee quit working. This only lasted eight months and the heating element quit working. It worked good everyday up to this point. If guess if I only used it every other day I might if got sixteen months out of it!After reading reviews elsewhere, Mr Coffee has the reputation that their products stop working after a few months. If you want a throwaway product this is it. I'm done buying Mr Coffee products."
Glenn Sullivan,2.0,"September 14, 2015","Lasted only a few months and the heater stopped working. Always took about 10 min for it to actually brew as the drip was slow, but maybe that is just the best way to make the coffee anyway. Still..........broke way too quickly."

Chad,1.0,"October 4, 2014","I can't even use the coffee maker.  After reading so many reviews praising this maker, I bought it.  As I put it on the counter getting it out of the box, I realized that it slid around on the counter with just the slightest tap of my hand.  It had the non-slide guards on the back of it but it didn't stop the front from moving all over the place.  I tried to put it in a corner to keep it from moving but nope, it still slid around.  Can't brew coffee with a machine that won't stay still.  Will be returning and trying my luck again!"

Bobby B.nbbnnb,1.0,"May 8, 2016",I bought this December 27 and it did not even last six months. I've kept up with the cleanings too but the electronics have stopped working. When I push the start button nothing happens and yes it is plugged in I even tried different outlets nothing on the electronic section works. Ridiculous! I think Amazon suppliers dropped the ball here. Very disappointed
KKB,5.0,"October 31, 2013","I purchased this coffeemaker based on the Consumer Reports review.  We were not disappointed.  The coffee maker works great, and makes a good cup of coffee.  It's easy to use, and includes a water filter.  It's also very reasonably priced."
Larry G.,5.0,"July 23, 2015","Our old Braun coffee maker finally gave up the ghost and so we were on the hunt for a new one. Unfortunately, that coffee maker was no longer being made so I searched and searched for a new one that would meet our needs (and must haves) and found this one. I was skeptical at first because it was a Mr. Coffee (a brand I thought of as cheap) but it had all the features we wanted and so I ordered it. Well, I can admit when I am wrong (don't tell my husband I said that) and can now say that this is an awesome coffee maker. It is quiet (our Braun was not), a beep lets you know when your coffee is done (another feature lacking in our Braun) and it has a timer which is a mandatory feature in our home. Great coffee maker which will not break the bank and has many great options. Highly recommend."
Jason L. Acevedo,1.0,"February 1, 2017","Bought this in February of 2016 and it worked fine.  In January of 2017 the heating element stopped working.  Called company and they said out of warrant, tough luck.  Thought I would get more than 11 months out of it."
Betty,5.0,"December 28, 2013","The Mr. Coffee I bought earlier this month meets & surpasses my expectations.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that is interested in buying a new Coffee Maker.  A friend of mine recommended, with a high rating to me."
Randy J,5.0,"September 26, 2014","I bought this coffee maker sight unseen based on its top rating in Consumer Reports and the Amazon customer reviews. We drink coffee every morning, and I'm picky about my brewing equipment. This coffee maker is great."
jaksen1939,1.0,"January 9, 2012",This product has a very large foot print and looks cheap.  It did not work well and we could not get it to produce coffee.  We are in our 70s and have been longtime coffee drinkers therefore it is obvious that we have made more than a few pots of coffee using more than one coffee maker.  Wepurchased it because it was rated as #1 in the consumer report.  We will not trust their reviewswithout more research than they provide.  I could not recommned this coffee pot to anyone.We do appreciate Amazon for their integrity and ease of consumer purchasing.
Don’t do it,2.0,"March 24, 2015",Reading the digital clock/timer is hard as it is not lighted but everything else is fine...  well I am changing this to 2 stars as after just 4 months and only brewing one pot of coffee in the morning...  it no longer works.
D. B.,4.0,"July 14, 2015","This brewer is a little confusing at first, but is really simple to use after reading the directions. Prepping it for the next morning is a breeze.I'm a little concerned that since I've used it, the water never fully dries from the inside compartment, unless I leave the lid open for hours. I've had the brewer 3 or 4 months now and nothing's gone wrong, meaning I'm not sick, but stagnant water makes me wonder if bacteria could grow in this machine.The coffee comes out too hot. I burn myself on the coffee all the time. I need to wait 10 or 15 minutes before after pouring to drink it or mix in ice cubes."
LR,1.0,"September 27, 2012","This coffee maker had a very high consumer report rating, but turns out to be unreliable, at best. The water doesn't come through evenly, so you have to shake the basket to make sure the coffee is evenly distributed, and you have to add more coffee than usual for it not to taste weak. Also,setting the clock and timer is a challenge because when you press the minute or hour buttons, instead of pausing when you want it, the numbers just keep firing on and on. Even after unplugging and replugging it! I would not buy this product again, and discourage anyone else considering it."
Cori D,1.0,"May 28, 2016","I would give it a negative if I could. We've had this coffee pot for 3 weeks and it no longer works. We brew a 12 cup pot daily. All the lights turn on but the plate doesn't get hot and it doesn't brew at all. I wound up looking on the Mr. coffee website to troubleshoot and to my surprise this coffee pot was a 1 star rating. Apparently this is a common problem, I just wish I would have done better research and not trusted the Amazon reviews."
Superstar,3.0,"December 1, 2014",We always brew a full 12 cups of coffee every morning.  The spout on the carafe is very shallow and doesn't pour cleanly.  Many times when we pour our first cup we find the carafe spills over the edges and is quite messy.Coffee is good though
Greg M,3.0,"August 5, 2014","Made one-half of a pot, then died. Thanks to Amazon's return system, got another unit that works!  Note that the unit is advertised as ""brushed chrome""; it is not brushed at all.  I find the fill and the basket for the coffee to be cumbersome.  But, it works."

beaver island guy,1.0,"September 7, 2012","Several major things wrong with this coffee maker after 6 weeks of use.  First, the brewed coffee has a distinct off taste likely from the plastics used. (A very high grade of fresh ground beans are always used.) Second, it brews extremely fast even on the ""strong"" setting. Third , for no apparent reason it sometimes dumps the brewed coffee on the counter. Fourth, the optional bronze filter basket only holds coffee for 8 cups as does the optional carafe.  This one is heading for the trash. I would return it to Amazon for a refund if it wasn't for discarding the box.  We are going back to a Delongi or Krupps."
Zippykay,4.0,"April 11, 2015",It was recommended by Consumer Reports and is an adequate coffee maker. My guests think it make coffee which is hot enough but I always have to microwave it to get it to the temperature that I like.

Elizabeth,4.0,"March 6, 2013","I purchased this coffee pot approximately a month ago and use it everyday.  I am exceptionally happy with the functionality of the coffee pot, but was a little thrown off by the very shiny and visibly plastic front of the coffee maker.

Caitlin G.,5.0,"June 19, 2013",I am so pleased with this coffee maker. It was so inexpensive but it performs like a really expensive machine. It also looks really great on my counter. I was prepared to purchase a more expensive coffee maker when I came across this one. My whole family loves it.
Amazon Customer,2.0,"September 21, 2013","I do not usually review products but this one deserves a few words.  The coffee maker brews a really great pot of coffee right out of the box, but a design flaw sends all the steam right up across the electronics and brewing element. After a few weeks this started shorting out the electronics causing the brew function to not turn on (rendering it pretty useless as a coffee pot).  If you wait a day or so for it to dry out it usually works again but it is a pretty inconsistent product."
Bonnie E. Rice,3.0,"June 5, 2016",The pot was packed upside down and broke as soon as the coffee maker was pulled out of the box - no warning on package just slid out and broke.Boo.

Ichabod,1.0,"December 26, 2014","Usually I'm a careful reader of reviews, but I missed something, or I happened to get a defective Mr. Coffee coffee-maker. One of the selling points is that it ""keeps coffee hot for 2-hrs ... ."" I like my coffee hot, so I pour only one-fourth cup at a time into my heavy coffee mug (that helps retain heat) . By the time I pour the second quick cup, Mr. Coffee has kept the coffee only luke warm. I see why a yellow half-slip of paper was added to the shipment. This slip contains instructions to POUR HOT WATER INTO THE METAL CARAFE TO HEAT IT BEFORE MAKING THE COFFEE. I tried that, and Mr. Coffee kept my second one-fourth cup warm. I was able to have hot coffee only by heating water to heat my coffee CUP prior to the pouring."
Astara,5.0,"August 25, 2013","I really like this version of the""Mr Coffee"" coffeemaker better than the plastic versions. I bought the stainless carafe and use it instead of the glass one. Keeps coffee warm for a long time. Looks good and makes great coffee!"
Gilbert Gimm,4.0,"October 31, 2014","I purchased this Mr. Coffee in summer 2014 (Best Buy in Consumer Reports) to replace a Braun coffeemaker that we had for 10+ years.  My first choice was to replace the Braun, but it's no longer readily available in the United States.  Overall, the Mr. Coffee maker has performed well in providing a nice tasting cup of Columbian coffee.  One advantage of this model is that it does not occupy as much space on your kitchen counter as a larger Cuisinart model (if space is limited in your kitchen).We use the strong brew option and a permanent filter, which appears to preserve much of the flavor from the ground beans.  It's relatively easy to clean the permanent filter, but I still miss the Braun coffeemaker at times (which had a cone filter system allowing for convenient disposal of paper filters). The only limitation of the Mr. Coffee machine is that you have align the notch of the basket into the main compartment in order to allow the coffee to flow down into the top opening of the glass carafe.  If the notch is not perfectly aligned, the coffee will accumulate in the basket and then overflow, spilling coffee all over the machine and generating a mess.  It's a minor annoyance that you may experience one time and will probably never do again.After cleaning out the permanent filer and rinsing the basket, I usually open up the cover lid to allow the unit to ""breathe"" and dry out.  I would recommend avoiding daily use of the dishwasher to clean the filter, basket, or glass carafe.  Letting it air dry helps to retain the flavor of coffee, which improves on your third or fourth brewing.  You can't go wrong with purchasing this coffeemaker, especially if you are trying to replace an older Braun model (10-cup coffeemaker with cone filters)."
Pinkphish,1.0,"July 15, 2013","This coffee maker is a total disaster.  We bought it based on consumer reports recommendation and because we wanted a coffee maker with a timer.  Either we got a lemon or other users like very weak coffee.  First time we used it the coffee overflowed the filter.  For obvious reasons we were reluctant to try the timer... We tried using less coffee, tried not using the disc ""filter"" that balances on top of the basket, and tried brewing a smaller amount.  Still have issues with not flowing correctly into carafe.  Also it does not recognize the thermal carafe and overflows onto the counter.  I have never had such problems with a coffee maker!!!"
Matt,1.0,"May 18, 2016","Worked for 2 months and then stopped responding to commands, doesn't make coffee because the heating element just doesn't do anything. Maybe I just got unlucky, but boy was it upsetting to pay this much money for a counterop digital clock."

Anonymous,4.0,"June 11, 2017",The product traps a lot of moisture in the lid and you have to leave the lid open or it molds.
bosephus,5.0,"October 13, 2013","We drink a lot of coffee, and go through a coffeemaker every 1-2 years. This one is one of the better, simpler ones to use in recent memory. Easy to clean, and makes good coffee. Much better then the more expensive one it replaced."
DianaD,1.0,"October 9, 2012","For the money, this is just an okay coffee maker.  The coffee isn't hot enough, and if you add a little bit of creamer, it's lukewarm at best. Also, it shuts off after two hours.  It would be nice if the shut-off time could be adjusted for additional time."
Judith S. Miller,1.0,"June 20, 2014","It overheats and shuts off--have to stop in middle of brew cycle, let it cool, then plug in and I might get another min ute or two of brewing -- will NEVER buy Mr. Coffee againAmazon should STOP carrying them"
eli ford,3.0,"September 22, 2014","This coffee maker is ""meh"" in almost every way. It makes coffee well enough but it's pretty ugly and takes up a bit too much space. That being said, it's programmable which is great and convenient.For this price, you might not be able to do much better."
M. Clark,4.0,"July 12, 2013","I like this coffeemaker, the only feature I would like to have though is a ""pause and serve"" option. You cannot sneak a cup before the brewing is done...but maybe that is God telling me to be more patient. Ha ha, it's great for what it is."
Gary L. Stewart,5.0,"January 18, 2014",Needed to replace a Braun coffeemaker which we loved and this one was highly rated. Makes hot coffee (some machines don't get water hot enough) and keeps it hot. Very easy to clean as well.
John Denham,5.0,"February 9, 2013","This is a lot more coffeemaker than its price would indicate.  Brews good coffee.  Keeps it hot.  The automatic timer works just fine.  Nice, clean design to boot.  --  I did not experience any ""plastic"" smell reported by others."
KEVC,2.0,"March 21, 2016","This coffee maker worked just fine and made good coffee for me for about 11 months before it died suddenly. Turned it on one morning and the lights came on, but it would not start brewing. I normally made coffee once /day in the morning. The machine wasn't used heavily. Expected to get at least a couple years out of this thing. Disappointing."
Ron,5.0,"April 4, 2018",So far so good.  I only wish the clock display was backlit.

educated consumer,5.0,"November 26, 2011","Reviews already posted that were positive were very accurate about this very well made inexpensive coffee maker ($30 plus free shipping was a real bargain from Amazon). Read the instructions and do run the system at least three times to get rid of the new plastic smell (baking soda worked fine). Easy to use if you follow instructions as to where to pour water, moving the water spout to the side, placing the basket. Excellent features such as 2 hour auto turn off and beeps for ready and off, easy to clean,and very attractive even in a high end kitchen. You can't go wrong.  (Note I do not have any other reviews)."
Zebra,5.0,"June 11, 2014","I bought this back in March and loved it so much bought another for a backup.  Nice and hot coffee and keeps warm.  The style is very modern, the size is great for a smaller counter top and looks very expensive.."
Jeffrey W.,5.0,"November 14, 2015",A great cup of coffee every time. It helps to run a small amount of water through before making a full pot of coffee as it helps to remove oils and heats up the caraff.
CatCullen,5.0,"January 30, 2016","Because no coffee pot lasts that long, I've given up on buying expensive ones.  If you are like me, in the market for the bargain makers, buy this one.  I had the earlier version of this model for the last two years, until it gave out a few weeks ago.  Luckily Amazon delivered this one in a same-day delivery for me!  I would have given it 4.5 stars if that was an option only because they changed the buttons on this version and there is no longer any button that just says ""start"" or ""on"".  As ridiculous as this sounds, it took me a few pages of instruction manual reading to figure out how to get the darn thing to just start brewing.  Once I learned the ""Select/Off"" button is really the on/start button, everything works fine.  It has an automatic timer, turns itself off 2 hours after brewing, has available water filters (your choice to use or not), and brews a good & hot pot of coffee.  What else does one need?"
Amazon Customer,5.0,"September 29, 2014",The wife and I were interested in a Coffee maker that made coffee quickly....we opted to buy this one for Mr. Coffee quality and the ability to set the timer to have coffee made when we awaken.  Awesome coffeemaker!!!
R. P. Provencher,4.0,"April 20, 2015","While on vacation we used one of these.  Usually, at home, we used a K cup coffee maker.  This unit is much more economical for morning multiple cups for my wife and I.  We still use the K cup for periodic afternoon servings. Try it you will save money."
Muleears,3.0,"September 1, 2015","Seems to work ok, looks nice.  Only complaint is that if you leave the lid open and watch it work you will see that it takes about half of the brewing time to get all the coffee wet.  It drops all the water in one spot and leaves the rest dry.  We have taken to removing the pot so it won't drip and letting the basket fill with water before putting the pot back and letting the coffee out.  This ensures all the coffee grounds get included in making coffee.  Sometime we do this two or three times during a brewing session.  Doesn't work as well as my Bunn did but the Bunn died after many years of service.  This one was a good price and well recommended.  Three stars is the max though."
Bowlindad,3.0,"April 26, 2016","Purchased June 11, 2015. This guy was FANTASTIC... while it worked. It died mid-April, 2016, so it only functioned for less than a year. It also had tendencies to overflow on the top, and thus create gigantic messes of coffee in the morning. Coffee tasted great, while it lasted. At least it's not very expensive."
RickMD,5.0,"June 16, 2011","I order bean coffee online and am very particular about my coffee. I've had several of the $150 plus coffee makers over the past ten years and when the last one died, I thought I'd give a ""cheapo"" a try.  This coffee maker makes as good a cup of coffee as any of my previous, overpriced machines.  The only issue is that filling the reservoir isn't as easy as some models, however it's a minor drawback.  For a machine that does the same thing as products costing five to eight times as much, I'd say you can't go wrong."
Sadak,5.0,"February 8, 2014",The new Mr. Coffee pot configuration is so much better than the older generation.  You can actually clean the inside without too much effort.  The rest of the maker works as advertised.  Looks nice on counter as well.
Amazon Customer,2.0,"March 30, 2017","Nice features and easy pour access to add water. Have been a Mr. Coffee customer for decades. Most last several years, this one didn't make it 1 before it died. These are electronic devices and I'll chalk it up to acceptable failure rate, just not willing to revisit the same model. I'm still a Mr. Coffee customer, but the Costco model this time which I have always had very good luck with."
Twink,5.0,"January 29, 2015","Bought as a gift for my parents. They are really pleased with it. They said it was easy to set up and to operate, it's very pretty (they even sent me a photo of it), and it makes great coffee."
arlene horelick,3.0,"May 16, 2013","I checked with Consumer Reports and they said this coffee maker was as good as the ones priced twice as much.  I like the looks of this Mr. Coffee, but I don't think the flavor comes through as well as a more expensive one.  I buy good coffee, Starbucks, and I use filtered water, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.  Also, after removing the filter basket and the pot, the top inside of the coffee maker has a great deal of condensation on the lid, and it doesn't dry up naturally.  So, consequentially, I have to wipe it out everyday.  Bummer!!!"
H.,5.0,"July 7, 2015",Initially it gave a plastic smell. But after 2-3 brews daily for past 8 months I am surprised that it still stands quite well. Part of my surprise come from the cheaper price I paid back then.
Michael C. Downing,5.0,"December 20, 2013",The wife was buying a coffee maker every month. she said the coffee didn't taste right purchased this one a few months ago she make 2-3 pots a day no complaints when this one wears out I will be back for another.

Tony,1.0,"June 9, 2016","This machine is a real disappointment. I haven't even owned it for a year and it's already broken. This would be acceptable if I'd picked up a $10 coffee maker to brew a quick cup on the go but when I spend over $30 on an appliance, I don't expect it to unexpectedly conk out after less than 12 months. You can make your own decision, but if you value your money and want a durable coffee maker, take a pass on Mr. Coffee."
DR M.,4.0,"October 27, 2012",I have been using this product for several weeks.  It works very well.  My only issue is that it has taken several weeks to get rid of the plastic odor.  I recommend keeping to top open to air out during the first weeks of use.
Ringerag,2.0,"March 26, 2016",Bought a little over a year ago and it just stopped working. The lights were on but no brewing or hot plate. Recommendation was to see a service center.... Not!!! Back to Cusinart!

Jesse Schneider,5.0,"November 12, 2014","Great coffee maker.  Easy operation.  None of the funky smells/tastes as mentioned in a few other reviews.  I ran vinegar through a few times, and then I ran a water/baking soda mixture through."
RIK  L.,4.0,"November 8, 2015","Easy to set time , the chrome faced coffee maker looks good on the counter, and the ""delay"" feature is very nice so you can wake up to a cup of  fresh brewed coffee !!!"
Evelyn,4.0,"September 29, 2013","I' m into the first week of using this coffeemaker and so far it brews a fantastic pot of coffee.  Not too many features that make it complicated.  I've been looking for a coffeemaker for a while now.  Bought a Cuisinart with a built-in grinder.  Nice idea but spending too much time cleaning so I returned it without any problems.  This Mr. Coffee had high reviews so decided to give it a try.  So far, it's functions well.  If the markings for the water level were in front and easy to see, I'd give it a 5 star.  I would recommend it to any coffee drinker."
Az Pink Lady,4.0,"July 24, 2016","I like this coffee pot. However, it irritates me that when it beeps, it is not really done brewing. It continues to drip/pour when you remove the pot after the beep. You must give it about a minute more to finish the last little bit to empty in the pot. Or else you have a mess on your counter. It should beep when it's really done."
K_Taylor,4.0,"October 11, 2011","For the $20 dollars this Mr. Coffee Machine cost, it's EXCELLENT! The ease of setting the timers and clock is great. There is not a back-light for the clock, as some of the other reviews do mention. The cord is short, yes, but long enough that I have it sitting on a kitchen side table and it still reaches the outlet. about 2-3 feet long. I also like that you can separately  purchase a travel thermos and it has a setting to only fill the thermos or a whole pot depending on what you want. It doesn't drip or spill while trying to pour water into the compartment in the back, nor while pouring a cup of coffee. The ONLY thing I could say annoying about this machine is that it is a tad bit noisy, NOT while it is brewing, but once it is done and sitting there on the warmer. It crackles and pops and almost sounds like the pot is going to explode! It's not a continuous noise, but will do it every 5 minutes or so. Other than that, this coffee maker is great and my husband loves it because he no longer has to make 10 pots of coffee during the day, as it holds 12 cups versus or old one that only held 4 cups. :)"

Bob Bruss,5.0,"February 3, 2014",We use one third less coffee per pot then with the older coffeemakers. That means every third pot of coffee is free. Bought two frfo our church kitchen too and one for our camper. Best coffeemaker for the money.

I currently use a Küreg right now and not that there is anything wrong with it; it just doesn't make a great cup of coffee. The Mr. Coffee is the complete opposite. The programmable time function that you can set to have it brew is a really nice feature and while I understand that other coffee makers do that, the price and simplicity is what's separates this apart from other brands. It's nice to have it set up the night before and wake up to the small of a great brew. I'm currently drinking coffee from the machine and writing this review. I would recommend this to anyone who is an avid coffee drinker who really appreciates a good cup of joe."

calico,5.0,"February 20, 2015",I've had this coffee maker for almost 2 months and it has worked beautifully.  We also purchased the stainless steel carafe and are happy with it as well.  The directions remind you to warm the karafe by pouring hot water in it before making coffee.  Doing so keeps the coffee nice and hot.  It is a good machine for the money.
cici,2.0,"June 27, 2016",Lasted only 6 months!  It was a great appliance until it just suddenly quit.  Not worth time or money to pack up and send to the company.  I will definitely try another brand.

TheOtherMrsM,5.0,"March 14, 2016","I drink a lot of coffee...so I wanted a reliable, well-made brewer.This particular model can brew either for the glass carafe (which comes with the machine)or in a thermal pot, which is a neat feature.It has a timer, brew-n-pause feature, and a brew strength selector.All of which were MUSTS for me.One lesson I did learn the ""hard"" way, is that extreme care should be taken when cleaningthis brewer.  I believe that water got into the electrics, and shorted it out.If you knew me, you would know, this meant a dire situation.However, I just left the machine to dry out for that time, and after the three days,it began working again.I have now had this coffeemaker for over four years, and am still very happy with it."
rob kel,5.0,"October 8, 2014","I purchased this for my wife she seams to forget to turn her old coffee maker off a lot more lately this means it is time to get a new one for her that will take care of that buy itself.

We were pleasantly surprised that the coffee is hot when made and for sometime afterwards. Also, in response to some of the other reviews, we never did get the plasticy smell. However, we did run 2 cycles of distilled white vinegar and 2 cycles of plain water before testing out the coffeemaker. The programmable functions are easy to figure out.

Keith Conrad,3.0,"October 30, 2013","I am somewhat disappointed with this product.  On the plus side, it brews a decent cup of coffee.  However, I think the controls are more complicated than they need to be.  Also, it almost always drips coffee on to the heating pad, when I pull out the pot.  I usually have to wait five or so minutes after the brewing is complete to keep this from happening.  Sometimes, this doesn't even prevent this from happening. I am not sure if I would ever buy a Mr. Coffee again."
Darrell Trout,1.0,"September 25, 2015",I bought this in June and it stopped working last week (less than 4 months). I would not respond at all or brew coffee. I decided it was not worth it to return it so threw it out and bought another brand. I had modest expectations which were not met.

Stephen,3.0,"August 26, 2012","Unlike the Crusinart previous owned for years (12), this Consumer report best buy product is a mess after brewing and hARD TO CLEAN. THE FUNCTION IS oK BUT THE TEMPERATUE IS WEAKWill not buy another Mr. Coffee cheaply mabe CM"
jim m.,5.0,"November 8, 2015","We are very happy with our new coffee maker. We replaced a Bunn which we had for 15 years and it was still working but they cost more to operate because they keep the water hot 24/7. Bottomline, the Mr Coffee makes a much better cup of coffee and we love the automatic shut off after 2 hours."
Mary and Dave Edrington,4.0,"June 29, 2016",I always buy Mr Coffee because it is reliable and easy to work. . .this one was a gift and they seem very pleased with it. . .
Panchi,4.0,"November 5, 2014","Good coffeemaker at a very reasonable price. The only drawback is replacing the filter each month. Easy to replace, but another expense. Other than that, I like everything about it"
Mom,3.0,"June 17, 2020","I replaced this pot with the exact same I had before.  For the price paid, I should have at least gotten the gold filter basket"
Jamie Hanley,5.0,"June 18, 2014","Received this today, has quite a bit of features.. Coffee brews very hot, unlike a lot of brewers. needs coffee filters which I usually like the wire reusable filter.. Good price, and I would recommend..."
Adnan Ahmed,1.0,"September 11, 2015",I don't like this coffee maker. Wanted to switch back to a regular coffee maker from a Keurig to be environment friendly and got this based on reviews. More coffee ends up in the reservoir instead of the carafe and it tastes awful. Returning it after only 2 uses
John Jones,2.0,"February 14, 2015","Had it for a year and a half but going to replace it. The burner corrodes and looks like heck, but unlike a metal burner it can't be cleaned. Time to spend more for something long-lasting."
JudyS,5.0,"March 1, 2013","Love my ""upscale"" Mr. Coffee!  It arrived promptly, packaged well, and is everything I expected.  The new smell didn't wear off for a few cycles but other than that, it is great and worth every penny!"
Debra Jo,4.0,"January 25, 2014",This coffeemaker makes good coffee... Is not real heavy duty and is plastic... We go through about one coffeemaker a year so decided to give this a try after it was recommended in Consumers Report !
grandma6,4.0,"June 29, 2013",My favorite feature  is the Regular or Strong Brew option!  I also received the gold filter to go with this model and that makes it even more user friendly.  Beeps (quietly) when the brewimg process is complete.
Jean M. Davis,3.0,"April 6, 2015","This is our second Mr. Coffee of this design. I like it except for one very aggravating feature: If I try to pour a cup while the machine is still brewing, the basket leaks. Our other Mr. Coffee did this as well."
TCM,1.0,"January 9, 2017",Started leaking water internally today. When I filled it water started coming out the bottom.  Haven't even owned the product 1 year yet.  I have taken very good care of it. No good reason for this to happen besides being a manufacturers defect
John Krause,4.0,"March 7, 2015","Makes good coffee but I need to push the ""strong"" button every time. It defaults to ""regular"" which seems to come out weak. I do not like real strong coffee but strong is normal and if you forget to push ""strong"", it will come out weak, which is frustrating."
Bryan,2.0,"August 30, 2015","This coffee maker worked pretty well for about half a year. Despite cleaning periodically with vinegar, it became quite slow to brew, and would beep as if done half an hour before actually finishing. Finally, after about 8 months, it stopped working altogether."
Annie Silver,5.0,"June 3, 2015","This is one of those no brainer items. It works quietly, quickly, the lights remind me of a beautiful car's dashboard! Zero negative comments about this product."
Katrinka,5.0,"August 20, 2013","This coffee maker works really easily and reliably. The programming feature is nice because you prepare coffee at night,set the time you want it to make coffee, and it is available for you the next morning"
gooffee13,3.0,"August 25, 2014",This coffee maker is nice BUT...the display window ALWAYS has condensation in it so you can't see when you want to program it for a certain time to start brewing and what not. I have had it for less than 1 year!
Joshua R Wilkes,5.0,"December 3, 2013",I love it.  It's easy to use & makes great coffee.  I like the setting where you can make a strong brew or normal brew.  You can really tell the difference between the two!I'm very happy with my purchase.
Steve,5.0,"February 21, 2015","Ran a pot of water through it, and brewed the next day. Keeps coffee hot longer than last coffeemaker, and I haven't detected any odor.  Looks great, works great so far."
Lora A McPherson,1.0,"August 28, 2016",Bought this In May and now it doesn't work..A waste of money and the time it took to open the box..not worth 1 star
Jennifer W,5.0,"November 4, 2015",Great coffeemaker.  Perfect size and looks modern and sleek.  I like the ability for setting the timer and also the brew strength.  No complaints!
MOgranny,5.0,"August 10, 2013","Have had several different brands of coffee makers over the years and we think this one is one of the better ones.  Nice size and design, east to clean and set up for the next day.  Would buy again."
RCC,4.0,"May 7, 2016","This makes great coffee, and it is fairly simple to use.  A couple of minor cons:1) The display is not lit, so it is difficult to see unless in very good lighting.2) The method of setting a delayed brew seems a bit random.  I have not figured out a consistent way to do it, I just press the buttons until the proper lights are lit.3) The basket sometimes fails to seat properly and overflows coffee and grounds all over everything.Now for the pros:1) Makes excellent coffee.2) Has a setting for a stronger brew.3) Has a delayed brew feature.4) Glass carafe, which only dribbles a little (most dribble a LOT).5) Auto off works well.6) Beep when brewing is done.7) A bargain!"
illini47,5.0,"April 28, 2018",Excellent product.
Brad Ochs,5.0,"September 4, 2017",Wife loves it. Timer makes mornings easier. Nice to wake to smell of coffee already brewing.
Matthew Lageman,1.0,"January 19, 2016","Up until a couple of weeks ago, this would have been a 4 or 5 star rating. This coffee pot did everything that I wanted it to and it looked very nice in our kitchen. Then the heating unit just stopped working. Nothing that I can find to explain it, it just stopped working. I have had probably 10 different coffee pots in my life and never spend more than $20 on any of them. Every one of them lasted several years and I replaced them more out of boredom than anything else. I spent a little bit more money on this thinking I could have one that looks nice and works well. Turns out, the one I got was nothing more than looks. On top of that, since I purchased it on Amazon, all I can find is a 30 return policy. I doubt that I will be purchasing another Mr. Coffee product in the future."
Kindle Customer,3.0,"February 4, 2018",Worked fine for 2 years. This morning it quit working. Turns on but no longer brews.
JAK,5.0,"January 5, 2015",We love this coffeemaker!!! Our son gave us a Keurig for Christmas but for the price of this coffeemaker it is a Very Good Product @ a good price.
Di G.,5.0,"December 3, 2014",Awesome coffee machine. Makes the perfect coffee every time. Stylish and easy to use. Did not experience any of the issues in any of the negative ratings. Highly recommended.
Overkill,5.0,"September 5, 2013",We had a coffee maker that you had to pour over the sink because it dripped as you poured. I cant believe we waited this long to get this one. It makes great coffee and is easy to use and it pours good!
Wills1071,3.0,"February 16, 2017","Worked well, easy to use. Really liked the option of a strong setting. Really did not like that it suddenly died after only about ten months, especially since I've gotten longer use out of this brand in the past. But I used it every day so I guess it did okay for the price."
Rosiet,5.0,"December 2, 2013","Terrific value!  Fast, reliable and makes a great cup of coffee!  We will buy another & would recommend as it is smaller than the $100 models and makes a better brew...and is FAST!"
James D. Erickson,2.0,"October 31, 2014","Ours works as expected, however, my son bought one, it failed, the company replaced it, then the replacement failed, the third is working so far, but it's extremely noisy! Gurgles, pops and etc., does work however."
Wendy,5.0,"January 23, 2014","This coffee maker is great. You can even choose to have your coffee brewed stronger. I don't really like the extra filter that they give you. . . it always gets in the way, and I just stopped using it altogether."
mind expansion through knowledge,5.0,"July 17, 2014","Brews some seriously decent java.  I experienced zero of the issues others have reported having.  It works consistently, and the coffee tastes consistently perfect.  All I could ask for."
Vada,5.0,"February 9, 2014",I like having a coffee maker I can program the night before and this one makes it super easy. It's nice that I can set a regular or strong brew as well.All of the parts are easy to remove and clean and the unit itself has a neat tidy appearance.I have no problems with getting the water hot enough and we use it almost every day without any issues. The carafe thankfully doesn't have the spill problem our old Sunbeam had. No messes to clean up.
Richard Slayton,4.0,"March 2, 2015",We have had one for a couple years and our second coffee pot went out on us so we were very pleased with the one we have I purchased another one. Now we have two good coffee makers. Thank you.
Abidehandy,5.0,"February 14, 2015","It brews coffee. My last one burned out a resistor, and it was cheaper to buy a new one than trying to find the correct part to fix it. ONlLY in America, is this possible. Hurray for Capitalism, we are so blessed in this United States Of America, I simply have to decide how much my time is worth, and decide to fix or not to fix a broken appliance, but because material needs are so cheap and available, it is not hard to decide what to do. Buy a new one. Period. This attitude is not possible in third world countries. I consider myself too blessed and so greatful for being a citizen of this great nation. I do not take anything for granted that is available to me ."
paula s stevens,4.0,"August 24, 2013",This is a great product--I only gave it 4 stars d/t it being slightly more complicated than my older one--as the lights distinguishing the delay and brew and delay program with my old vision can make you brew now lol!  I missed my morning coffee for a few days just waiting on it to get here but the smell of my coffee in the am--is heaven!
Eric,5.0,"February 17, 2013","For the money, this is easily the best coffeemaker I have ever purchased!  It makes good, hot coffee and the pot does not drip when pouring, a problem with many others.  The only thing it lacks is the ability to program 2 separate start times.  I also purchased the thermal carafe with it.  Love this option."
misfit girl,5.0,"September 18, 2017",Probably the best coffee maker for the money out there
Dr Dave Cohen,1.0,"January 1, 2014",A grea t review in a consumer magazine convinced to buy this machine. It is difficult to fill with coffee and filter. Make a B- coffee. My old Krups makes far superior coffee. It makes an A  A+ cup The Bunn will soon be a recycle gift or thrift donation. Too many electronic add ons that  do not make the coffee taste better. I really dislike this machine
Brian Vanvlymen,2.0,"August 30, 2015",I purchased the bean from Starbucks trying to make same as their coffee. however the Mr. Coffee tastes so awful I wish the Mr.Coffee is no BPA  and avoid hot water touch the plastic. The hot water tastes change and smelly bad because of their chemical touch from water. and I dont like it.So I had to put the bowl of water in the microwave then put in the filter bowl to avoid their product heat machine its taste so much better!
Sharon Goguen,1.0,"December 29, 2014","Ordered this for my 80 year old mama for Christmas this year. The clock light didn't work. She has to use a flash light to set the clock and the auto start. She called the manufacturing company and they said ""they had a lot of complaints that the light was to bright""...Really... They also told her some are made with lights and some aren't""... NOTHING in the web sight said that... BEWARE!"
Rhoop,5.0,"June 25, 2016","This is a great coffee pot , the coffee stays hot and love the 2 hour shut off and being able to set it up to auto brew at a certain time !"
muv666,4.0,"June 12, 2014","A good no-nonsense coffee maker that's easy to clean and easy to use. I like the water filter and the carafe is easy to hold and pour. Overall, feels a bit cheap compared to my old Cuisenart; carafe does drip a bit and the buttons could be more clearly laid out, but overall it works well for us."
shasta01,5.0,"August 28, 2016","It's a simple and easy coffee maker. This is my second one, I replaced the first after eight years of use"
Catherine Blount,5.0,"February 23, 2018","Great quality, on time delivery."
Claire,4.0,"June 2, 2014","Great price ,nice and compact.  Fits under the cabinet.  Brewsquickly at two settings: regular or strong coffee.  The coffee basket and filter are kind of a pain, so I don't use them. I just use paper ones.  The clock has hands, not digital.  Also, the handle sticks out, so it's kind of easy to knock it off the burner if you aren't careful."
ProgressiveBob,5.0,"March 18, 2015","This is an excellent coffemaker and the leading consumer test lab and magazine agrees. Excellent price. Very attractive, versatile and consistently high performing."
flutterby4x,5.0,"June 9, 2014","It's easy to use, nice looking, easy to clean and has a nice consolidated profile ... I am very happy with this coffee maker and feel it is a really good value."
Kindle Customer,5.0,"February 1, 2015",Has the temperature needed to brew a good cup of coffee 195 degrees really very pleased beause thelarge discount stores wanted 49.95. for same item.
M. Palacio,3.0,"August 24, 2016",Great coffee pot however lasts under a year.  We use the it 8-10 times a week; this is the 2nd time that it stopped working.
Michael J. Anderson,4.0,"January 28, 2013",Had this for about 3 months. So far does a great job. Purchased it based on extensive positive reviews and have not regretted it. Great coffee maker at a fantastic price.....and keeps the coffee really hot!
rkerr72,5.0,"March 24, 2015",The perfect little coffee pot! I thought i was downgrading when my Keurig pooped out. I bought this until i could afford a top of the line keurig again. No thanks. Im sticking with this. cant beat it!
Brian C.,2.0,"September 4, 2016","RIP Mr. Coffee 06-20-2015 - 08-15-2016 :(Mr. Coffee was a hard worker until the day he died, too bad his life was short!"
Digita,1.0,"July 9, 2014",The first time this machine brewed coffee that tasted like burned plastic.  The second time the whole kitchen smelled like burned plastic.  I have returned it ASAP.
Blonde-and-blue,5.0,"September 6, 2014","Works great! Lovely coffee. I love the water filter. However, just know the filter must be changed every month. The refill packs can be bought on here for a reasonable price."
LaVern,4.0,"April 12, 2012",Good coffee brewer with easy to us controls.  The carafe dripps coffee.  The Mr. Coffee carafe at work also drips coffee.  Shuch a well designed coffee maker to have such a poorly designed carafe was a disapointment.
Mike Riecken,5.0,"June 22, 2014","Almost perfect.  Have had several Mr. Coffee units over the years and been pretty happy with their overall design.The only thing I'd suggest with this one is having the clock display slightly larger & tilted at an angle for easier viewing.Most coffee makers are not at eye level so if on a counter,you have to bend down to see the display clearlyOther than that it has performed fawlessly & makes a great cup of Joe!"
Kevin T.,5.0,"June 14, 2018",Still going and easy to use.
Rararr,5.0,"January 1, 2015","Works perfectly. My wife loves it, especially the delayed brew setting. She gets to wake up with a fresh pot of coffee every morning. Looks nice. Good quality item."
Vikki C.,2.0,"August 18, 2015",Worked great for about 3 months...then it suddenly stopped working.  The cheaper ones seem to work just as well and last at least twice as long.  Would not recommend.
Kim,1.0,"October 29, 2013","Strong brew light (and voltage) stays on only for first 10 seconds.  Discarded, and bought a simple Melitta Pour-Over Coffee Brewer which costs much less and makes a much better cup of coffee."
Micky,5.0,"January 29, 2015","Makes great coffee, I usually only make 4 cups measured = 2 of my mugs but is also great when more people are around. Keeps coffee heated without turning bitter."
David,4.0,"November 24, 2013","This is a good economical coffee maker. The filter is somewhat cumbersome to get attached properly sometimes, but isn't a big deal. Coffee is a little slow to make, but also not a big deal."
James R. McCoy,4.0,"April 2, 2013",I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Cuisinart we bought only a little over a year ago that broke. I saw this coffeemaker in Consumer's Reports and was only $39.99 vs the nearly $100 we paid for the Cuisinart. It is a great coffeemaker for the price but I have one big giant complaint. They shipped the coffeemaker with absolutely zero basket filters. I have never bought a coffeemaker that didn't have a handful of filters until you got to the store to buy some. A big two thumbs down to whoever made that decision.
Virginia Edwards Booth,5.0,"December 14, 2013","I have not had any problems with this coffee maker. It brews 12 cups quickly and is easy to use. My husband will set it to start early in the morning. Just hard to keep the chrome clean, but that is normal.  I would recommend."
Pook,4.0,"August 26, 2016","The DELAY BREW TIMER does not work on either one that we purchased. (2).  If someone knows better than I do, to set it, please respond."
Lexuszze,3.0,"December 7, 2013","The coffee maker makes good coffee, however the condensation builds up just under the top where you put water. If you dont leave lid open after brewing, that water goes into the tank for next pot."
John,5.0,"March 25, 2014","I bought the gold filter to go with it which eliminates buying paper ones and gives coffee a great taste.  I made a pot of Starbucks decaf the other day, and it was awesome in this pot.  Very easy to use."
Amazon Customer,4.0,"February 2, 2017",Works great but does have some drips onto the plate if you get coffee while it is still brewing.
kathi maroney,5.0,"February 5, 2015","love this coffee pot, no drip from the glass container when filling the water compartment, which is a plus. Target had this listed for more money, great price."
J. Martin,2.0,"May 13, 2016",This was a great coffeemaker until it stopped working after just 5 months.
JeanCase,5.0,"November 8, 2013","This is one of the best drip coffee makers for its price that I have owned.  I love the chrome/black looks, and the easy-to-use features on the front.  I strongly recommend this coffeemaker."
Philip F.,2.0,"December 18, 2016",Im not saying that this product is bad. Its most likely just the one I received. The issue I had was everytime I brewed coffee it tasted like plastic. I brewed 3 full pots of water in the machine to get rid of the plastic taste and smell. But it did not work.
Jim Shivlie,5.0,"June 2, 2016",We've had Bunns for many years and switched to this and love it.  Very quick and like the chime when it's ready and when it shuts off.
Jim,4.0,"October 30, 2016",This coffee pot looks great (to me anyway) and produces very hot coffee. My only complaint is that it's a little tricky pouring in the water since the opening is too small .. but I've gotten the hang of it. For this reason I'll give it 4 out of 5 stars.
Chris Thompson,5.0,"May 5, 2016","Purchased in February, stopped working in May.  Mr. Coffee sending replacement.  Makes good coffee."
AlexP,1.0,"January 12, 2016","I already asked for a refund. Watery, weak coffee, that's what we drank. I gave this machine several chances, different brands of coffees (the best ones), I played with the buttons, with the water quantity. We tried everything for Mr Coffee to work, it is worthless."
Amazon Customer,5.0,"October 7, 2019",Still going strong after seven years; very good coffeemaker for the price.
Larry Sharland,3.0,"January 28, 2016",Did not realize that cover opened the way it operates. Other than that it works great and is a great value.
amazaddict,3.0,"December 26, 2014","Slowest coffee maker I've ever used.  Has taken up to 30 minutes to finish brewing an 8 cup pot.  Outside dimensions are on the large size for no apparent reason.  Otherwise it works ok, but its nothing special."
Jonah,1.0,"September 5, 2015",This thing was designed by a team of mentally challenged monkeys. Whenever we try to fill it with water it ends up leaking all over the counter.
Armando Sanchez,4.0,"October 18, 2015","Its faster to brew the coffee, and hotter than other coffee maker, and the alarm sound and let you know that the coffee is ready to serve."
Brian,1.0,"October 5, 2016",Purchased less than a year ago and this coffeemaker's heating element has already failed. I see the price has increased $12 since then; hopefully if you're considering purchasing this coffeemaker for yourself Mr. Coffee has put that money into increasing the quality of their goods.
philomena p. killigrew,5.0,"November 15, 2014","it is good to get re-acquainted with mr. coffee......I forgot how much better coffee can taste and how hot it stays, because I had to buy cheaper versions....thankyou...."
DSimeone,5.0,"November 8, 2014",Had a Cuisinart with craft container the rusted out through the bottom.  This is much cheaper and keeps the coffee hotter.  It is easy to clean and easy to put back together.  Love it!
Arleen B,1.0,"September 26, 2017","Died after 9 months. I bought the thermal carafe for it also, and now am somewhat committed to getting the same inferior product. Stay away."
GlendaK,1.0,"December 17, 2015","Loved this coffee pot when we first got it. However, after only three months of normal use, this pot failed to make coffee on the delay start. I bypassed the delay start, to brew now, and the maker failed to do anything. Looks like I'm in the market for a new coffee pot, again! I would not purchase this item again."
James L. Thompson,5.0,"December 11, 2013","This unit was bought to replace one that finally gave up the ghost, and I couldn't be more pleased. It makes a great cup of coffee, and does not take all day to ""gett'er"" done."
HFM15,5.0,"April 2, 2015","It took me a long time to decide on what coffee make to purchase. I'm so glad I chose this one. It makes really good coffee, I was really surprise by it."
Beauty,5.0,"January 15, 2017","Great product will not buy any other brand but this one, great tasting coffee and reasonably priced and SIMPLE to use"
Edward Hade,4.0,"December 7, 2016",Good product. Just wish the cup measurement was visible from the front of coffee pot.
Robert E. Smith,5.0,"September 23, 2017","We use it every day, love it, works great."
Nick Bendeck,1.0,"February 23, 2016","It stopped working after 1 week! I still can't believe it. I live outside the US so returning it was definitely out of the question because it was too expensive. I completely lost my money here, and I still haven't been able to chat with an Amazon representative. For a company who prides itself in customer service, it sure is hard to get a hold of you."
Ray Regan,5.0,"November 22, 2014",The reviews where spot on looks great and works even better very happy with my purchase and the price was just what I was looking for would very much recommend..
D. Butler,5.0,"April 15, 2013","I have had numerous drip coffee makers, high end to low end.  The one I always go back to is Mr. Coffee.  This is a great coffee maker.  Directions perfect and I would definitely recommend this one.  There's nothing like a great morning cup of coffee!"
Christopher L.,1.0,"April 29, 2015",Broke the first time I used it. Burning plastic smell. So I dumped everything out and tried it again and the water poured out the bottom all over the counter and floor. Worst coffee maker ever.
Elizabeth,2.0,"November 16, 2016","We purchased this coffee maker in Jannuary 2016. It is November 2016 now and it just stopped working altogether We used this as most families probably do, to make a pot of coffee each morning.. Terrible life span. Would not recommend if you are looking for something that will last a few years."
Teacher Mom,2.0,"November 23, 2013",This worked well for the first 10 months or so.  Then it started leaking water out the bottom back of the heating reservoir.  This machine should last longer than 10 months for the price.
Donna V. Dunlop,1.0,"November 15, 2015","We bought this machine less than a year ago.  It had challenges from the start, e.g. we continually got grounds in our coffee.  Now it has stopped working entirely.  Very frustrating. It was also excessively noisy and woke my daughter up from the floor above.  Would not buy again."
Pat Oakes,2.0,"June 30, 2016",1st one lasted 3 days - amazon gave us a new one. Lasted about a year before heating element burned out.
hv,3.0,"August 16, 2017",Made nice coffee but only lasted 2 years almost exactly to the day.
Amyi324,2.0,"August 29, 2012","I purchased this particular model based on Consumer Reports recommended coffee makers. At the time of purchase, it was the #1 rated coffee maker. As far as brewing a nice cup of joe, it does a decent job at the price I paid. I biggest complaint today is the fact that the carafe spills coffee all over the place when pouring a cup. This is enough to make me want to throw it out the window. I have tried pouring slow, fast, high, low and nothing prevents the massive spillage. It is a complete disaster."
JS,3.0,"December 30, 2012",This coffee maker makes good coffee within a reasonable period of time. Major defect is that the time on the clock window does not light up to be visible  and is difficult to see even when close up.
andrew h,4.0,"April 24, 2014",Does a good job brewing and comes with a filter that sits on top of the basket.  I don't think that is necessary for where I am since I have good drinking water but a nice option.
TwentyOneDragon,2.0,"July 15, 2016","Low-end and basic. Machine is all plastic except there's a stainless steel rim on the carafe.  The carafe glass quality is super fragile.It works fine. Requires paper filters.  Just looks really cheap in appearance.Suggest - go to Costco instead.  For the same money and manufacturer, lots more bells and whistles for price. Big difference - big!"
Sue M.,4.0,"October 2, 2013","I was looking for a moderately priced coffee maker that brewed good, hot coffee.  Consumer Report magazine rated this one high that is why I chose it. I have been pleased with the product in all ways. I would recommend this this model."
John Mitchell,4.0,"June 27, 2014","I have owned units that was a lot more money and units that were cheaper.  This is a very good pot for the money.  More than normal work to clean the various parts, but overall has worked well and results in a good pot of coffee."
SoCal customer,4.0,"January 2, 2014","The thermal carafe is an excellent addition. The coffeemaker senses the thermal carafe and turns off when the coffee is ready. No burnt coffee. The coffeemaker can make 12 cups with the glass carafe, but note that the thermal only holds 8 cups, due to thickness of its walls."
Myrna Beerkircher,4.0,"April 3, 2015",Very good coffee maker. Life is approximately one year. But we use it everyday. This is the third one I have purchased. Good value for a good price.
Scott,1.0,"November 21, 2016","Bought this coffee maker in January 2016 and it is already broken. It still turns on, but will no longer heat the water to make coffee. I do not recommend this coffee maker."
Debbie S.,1.0,"January 20, 2014","I bought this to give my parents for Christmas, and they especially loved the fact that it had a strong brew feature, so when I fnally took it out of the box last week and set it up for them, I was embarrassed to find out that the machine only beeps and turns its self off whenever you try to set it on the strong brew setting.  I could have gotten the cheapest model and got just as good of coffee as this brews.  I did everything possible to resolve the issue, but now I have read that others have the same problem.  Very disappointed!"
HSJones,2.0,"November 3, 2013","I'm disappointed in the quality of materials used. My last pot died in a power surge, and I thought I would get something a little nicer. This was a mistake. It runs fine, but the plastic cannot withstand much abuse."
ivar critch,5.0,"March 13, 2014","I gave this as a gift to friends who use it all day every day and treat it roughly.  It takes a beating and keeps on dripping! Costs less than those fancy-pants euro brands, too.  Recommended"
Amazon Customer,5.0,"December 18, 2018",Great
Jason,4.0,"August 30, 2016","Burns the coffee if you leave the heat on after the coffee is done, but otherwise works fine."
Thomas J. Linehan,1.0,"October 6, 2017",It stopped brewing  after a month of use.
David,1.0,"May 9, 2016",This coffee maker sucks!  Only lasted 4 months and quit working. I am through with Mr. Coffee. Buy anything else.
Robert M.,5.0,"October 28, 2014",I drink a good amount of coffee and this has been making a pot a day for months on end... Works awesome and the time delay is nice for the morning cup of coffee.
Raymer,5.0,"January 15, 2015",We normally go though at least one coffee maker per year.  This has worked out better than our Cruisart.  Sorry I am spelling that wrong.  But it is a great coffee maker.
GJacobson,3.0,"January 27, 2016",The plastic has a strong chemical smell that I can't get rid of. It makes the coffee taste chemical-y.
Dallas Dad,2.0,"March 10, 2016","It was awesome when it arrived 7months ago. Nice to have your coffee ready for you as you wake up in the morning. However, 7 months is just too short of a life span, the lights turn on but nobody is home. The coffee make just stopped, no heads up, nothing."
Abby,1.0,"May 29, 2016","My coffee tasted like plastic no matter how many times I cleaned it out. After a month or so, I just threw the whole thing out. (I didn't keep the box so I couldn't return it.) It is true you get what you pay for and since I bought a cheap coffee maker, I got lousy, plastic tasting coffee."
Annalara Ellerup,5.0,"March 24, 2015",Great hot coffee. And stays hot without burning taste. I like the 2 hour auto shut off instead of usual 1 hour. I agree that a backlight for the clock would be an improvement but not mandatory.
kajzar,1.0,"March 12, 2016",I purchased this the end of January and it stopped working in March
Nat P,5.0,"March 15, 2014",We have tried other coffee makers in the past but this one brews fast and hot. We have a lot of iron in our well water so we'll see how long it takes before it gets slow.
Dr Rob,5.0,"November 20, 2015","Makes great coffee!! Fast, feature packed, easy to use. I only wish it didn't beep when it finishes brewing, but it's a minor inconvenience and most people would probably appreciate the beeping!! =)"
Lynn arthur,5.0,"November 4, 2015","Very pleased with it.  Had a little trouble learning how to use it but with the help of a friend, found that it is a perfectly satisfactory and reasonably priced item."
Brittany Nelson,1.0,"June 7, 2016","I purchased this in January, not even 6 months ago, and its shot. Won't brew and hot plate does not get hot anymore. Worked absolutely fine yesterday..."
Antho12345,5.0,"August 3, 2015","the delay brewer works awesome and I love the timed shut off, because on my other coffee maker you had to make sure it was turned off or it would burn the leftovers in the pot."
B. J. Ogden,1.0,"February 8, 2017","I purchased this coffee maker back in Oct. 2015. It has lasted only a little over a year. It doesn't warm up or make coffee at all now. I know this isn't the most expensive coffee pot, but I have had others for a lot longer and didn't have any issues."
Barbara,4.0,"September 17, 2016",Nice coffee machine. Took off one star because the reservoir where you pour the water is a bit narrow/awkward to pour into.
lesley brar,5.0,"September 2, 2015","good machine. and well reviewed on line., dont spend on the fancy brands. this is a great product."
JuMarCh,5.0,"July 29, 2014",So many nit picky reviews! I just wanted to balance them out.  Coffee maker has done great for 6+ months with daily use.  No complaints at all!
Jack R,4.0,"December 21, 2013","compared to other coffee maker we had , this seems to be the best so far makes good coffee at a very fast time .haven't used the timer yet. so I can't comment . nothing negative to say about it . I recommend it.."
sparkle,4.0,"March 4, 2015",It makes good coffee if you are using no more than 5 tablespoons of coffee.  The basket needs to be bigger so the grounds don't overflow on making a full pot of coffee.
Warren Winner,1.0,"April 26, 2014","The 1st Mr. Coffee that we got at Target lasted 3 weeks and then it died.  We decided to upgrade and with the good reviews this model had gotten we elected to go with this one.  It brews a good cup of coffee.  After 5 days it was leaking at the bottom, and after 7 days it wasrunning like a river out the bottom.  Now back to the drawing board."
Kindle reader Black,1.0,"May 17, 2016",This coffee maker lasted for less than 6 months -- and was used less than once a day. Poor quality.
kutabato,2.0,"November 4, 2016",BROKE after 8 months use......tried everything but lights up but does not brew.worked well when it did but now just a piece of crap on the kitchen table.
John,5.0,"September 12, 2015",Replacing a more expensive Cuisinart coffee maker. Mr. Coffee was a good price and had all the features I need. Works great..
GSF,5.0,"February 2, 2014","This is a really good purchase, was received as described on Amazon. I have and will continue to purchase this one again when needed due to quality, price and convenience."
Larry H,1.0,"November 20, 2013",This item came with a missing part. That's pretty shoddy. You would think that Mr. Coffee would have better quality assurance in place. Obviously not. Do not buy this item.
Amazon Customer,3.0,"February 11, 2017",Normal coffee maker. Nothing special. Works and was shipped fast.
Jacoby W.,5.0,"February 4, 2017",Love. Best deal on this brand / model. The dark roast setting is an added bonus is you like your coffee black and strong.
K. W.,5.0,"May 18, 2018",Great coffee maker for when you need a pot.
CampingMama,3.0,"April 1, 2014",I had a much nicer coffeemaker that finally died.  I'm on a tight budget right now so went with this one.  It makes coffee fine and keeps it hot for as long as I drink it but it looks kind of cheap.
DWB from Jersey,1.0,"May 29, 2015",Too late to return it.  Keeps shutting off when brewing. PIA cause you have to stay with it throughout brew time. Yuk.  Don't buy it.
Meagan,5.0,"October 5, 2014",I'm always looking for nice products at the lowest price possible and this coffee pot is amazing for the price. It does everything I could possibly want.
Elliot Ketter,3.0,"February 22, 2015",So far so good. The downside is the amount of coffee it takes to brew a medium dark pot of coffee. I think this would be a good purchase for most.
Lisa K. Jolly,5.0,"September 27, 2016",This is our second one like this.  Love using the set timer to brew each morning.
TE,1.0,"October 29, 2015","Heating element went out in less than 3 months and it wouldn't work.  Yeah, I know it's only a $30 coffee maker but that's just lame."
Beverlee Whalen,5.0,"March 25, 2015",This coffee maker is great. Shuts off in two hours and it beeps to let you know it is shutting off. Very well made. Nice price saw in a store for 10.00 more.
Dusty Britches,5.0,"March 27, 2013","After doing the research (i.e., consumer report hasn't failed me yet), bought his maker the the gold tone permanent filter and have no regrets. The coffee maker is basic, yes solid workhorse. I love the permanent filter as well."
A. Lowell Snow,5.0,"February 6, 2017",good product
radha ramesh,1.0,"September 7, 2014",Brews and stops brewing... not a consistent function. Sometimes it works if you move the glass jar and nudge the top :(
Kathleen Ochander,4.0,"February 4, 2015","I have a question about this order.  It was a gift to my sister and she has received it and the light on the clock doesn't work so she cannot see the time nor able to set the timer clock without a flashlight.  This should work correct?She loves the coffee from it but wants a working light.  I plan to get a replacement.My daughter and I have the same coffee maker and we love it, that is why I chose it for my sister."
Kingman,5.0,"January 3, 2014",It does a good job of making coffee. It also does a good job of making coffee on a delay so I wake up and the whole house has the lovely aroMA OF COFFEE.
Aernst,1.0,"December 27, 2013",I just had to order a new coffee maker.  It wae purchased 10/2012 died 12/2013.  It lasted 14 months only.  Do not buy.  I just bought a new one on Amazon 12/25/2013.
Mark,1.0,"October 23, 2016",I bought this for my parents to replace their age old Mr. Coffee and this broke within a few months.  They had to pull out their old Mr. Coffee again.
gbm,1.0,"September 20, 2016","I usually like this coffeemaker, but this one smelled of plastic for months and when I tried to return it under the extended warranty, there was no way to do it.  If I find out how, I'll change my review, but so far, easier to buy the warranty than use it when a product is defective."
Ilham Kavrak,4.0,"January 13, 2015",so far so good but i had a simpler mrcoffee product before and it broke within 6 months for some reason i have no idea of so that is why 4 stars if continues working i will update the rating
Like to Buy,3.0,"February 18, 2016",The design where the buttons should be a little more user friendly.
Tom Laf,3.0,"September 20, 2016",Funtions well but makes coffee without the deep flavor and crisp aroma of my old Cuisinart.
Zubair Hussain,5.0,"August 8, 2015",this is my second coffee maker i love it its really nice looking and makes awesome coffee...
J. Smith,1.0,"March 28, 2015","This coffee maker is garbage. Mine in fact is garbage - it's resting with the other useless waste waiting for pickup next week.It makes weak, watery, flavorless coffee. Put in a few more grounds? Coffee's still weak. Double up on the filters? Coffee's still weak.Mr. Coffee, my eye! You should be called Mr. Warm Water."
Salem in Texas,5.0,"June 3, 2014",I bought this as a birthday present for my daughter and she loves it. She has been using it for a month and has no complaints. It was a great value at $32.
S.M.F.,2.0,"January 3, 2015","This didn't even last a year before it stopped working. It all lights up, but won't pull the water through anymore."
Kathryn S Ball,3.0,"October 2, 2015","This coffee maker worked fine to make coffee but on the second day after making the coffee, it immediately shut itself off. This happened here on after. I read the troubleshooting guide then called the Mr Coffee helpline. They were very nice & sent me a new coffeemaker."
CJ,5.0,"September 10, 2013",It was like a gift from heaven. I had moved to Alaska and my pot had broken.  This coffee pot works well and I love the automatic time set for mornings! It was fast delivery.
rwasser,1.0,"November 17, 2014",If you like smell and taste of plastic buy this coffee maker.  Read the reviews.  Also the hot water spout is off center so much of coffee grounds do not get evenly saturated with hot water.  Next stop Goodwill.
Alexi C.,2.0,"January 5, 2016",Coffee  doesn't  taste  good.  There is a bad new product  after taste with each batch.
Crockett4464,1.0,"September 4, 2015","After about a week, it leaked all over the counter and floor. I will not be buying another Mr. Coffee product!"
Endevour32,5.0,"December 11, 2013","Excellent product, just as pictured  and just as described, my girlfriend loves it, and if she's happy I'm happy, great product, works very well and is easy to use!"
BLR. Hansen,4.0,"November 5, 2013","Rated #1 by Consumer's Reports. Works well, but hard to set for auto start. Inside design is odd & skimpy. Has a swing arm over ground basket that does not look sturdy."
Amazon Customer,3.0,"April 12, 2016","Everything about this coffee maker has met my expectations except for the ""water filter"" that you are supposed to replace every month. Just another way for companies to suck money from consumers. I should have researched more and bought a coffee maker that has parts that don't need to be replaced monthly."
Jane,1.0,"July 14, 2014","Less than 3 months old and not working.  Lights will not come on and clock flashes 12:01.  The manual offers the helpful tip that if it is not working, plug it in. Duh!"
Larry,5.0,"December 7, 2011","The price was very reasonable, and it makes a good pot of coffee. Although some reviewers commented on difficulty pouring from the pot (spilling, dripping), I have had no such problems."
mophead,5.0,"December 17, 2013","Good looking, easy to operate and program.Push a button and make stronger coffee. Purchased a permanent filter basket and some water filters and am using regular tap water (not water softener).  A name you can trust is Mr. Coffee"
J. Green,1.0,"April 12, 2016",Stopped working after 4 months. Won't turn on. No refund.
JS1,4.0,"September 14, 2015","Very functional and good value for the money.  Was a bit confusing to put together, but when I finally figured it out, it worked great."
Ricardo,1.0,"April 18, 2016",This coffee maker quit working less than 2 months after it was delivered.  The lights come on but it never heats.  I probably will not buy this brand again.  I don't see myself chasing down a technician who is trained to say no to customers or who will send me on a wild goose chase.
Ms. Milner,5.0,"February 22, 2016","We are jumping for joy! We decided to sell our Keurig machine, and gained much freedom and happiness through this wonderful Mr. Coffee coffee maker! I love how you can program it to make coffee at a certain time! Grumpy momma bear in the morning? Not any longer when she smells the intoxicating aroma of freshly brewed coffee when she wakes up! Daddy in a hurry to get off to work? This coffee maker allows you to ""sneak in"" and grab a cup while it's still brewing, without spewing coffee all over the place!It also comes with a water filter, which we really appreciate!This is an all around excellent machine, and we really hope it holds up over time!"
Linda,4.0,"April 7, 2017",Very pleased with it 2 1/2 years after purchase.
Barbara Kovach,5.0,"November 21, 2015",Mr Coffee is working just great.  I especially appreciated the fast delivery as my old one did not work at all.
DM In ATL,1.0,"January 17, 2016",Worked fine for 12 months and started leaking. Took the bottom off and one of the plastic water lines had broken underneath the plastic clamp holding it ti the heating element.Not worth fixing.
Rudy,1.0,"January 12, 2016","Broke within five months. It's at the repair shop because it's still under warranty but five weeks later still no repaired coffeemaker. So, coffeemaker breaks quickly and customer service is terrible. You've been warned."
S. Jost,5.0,"October 28, 2013","We are enjoying this coffee maker.  After having a Keurig for a few years, my husband wanted a stronger and less expensive cup of coffee.  This makes it just right."
Diane L Miles,5.0,"August 12, 2015",always by Mr. Coffee pots only ones that work and this site delivers them on time and no damage they pack it real good
Anna Tiano,1.0,"May 5, 2016",i got this coffee marker  on 3- 3- 2016 n by 3-27-2016  it was dead the company send me a new one a weeks ago  so i hope it keep on working
CIELOAZUL,5.0,"October 28, 2011","I love this Coffee Machine , is beautiful and stylish, with a nice chrome finish makes a perfect companion with my other appliances, It's so easy to program and you Coffee's aroma  comes out so deliciously every morning! I love this baby. Great machine for it's price. Totally recommend !"
Larry Abel,5.0,"September 23, 2015",Consumer Reports was right.  This is a high quality Coffee maker that is durable and reliable.  Good product for the money.
woods,5.0,"March 26, 2012",We ordered this coffee pot because it was rated very high by Consumer Reports Magazine.  The one that this one replaced was also rated high 8 years ago.  This does live up to its rating!
Courtney,3.0,"June 16, 2016","This coffeemaker makes great coffee but unfortunately did not last very long.  I order on October 26, 2015 and it died on me last week.  I just had to order another.  The low price point and the fact that it makes excellent coffee is the only reason I am not researching other coffeemakers. 5 stars for coffee, 0 stars for not being able to live longer than 8 months."
Kindle Customer,5.0,"March 28, 2015",What a deal. Got this for $25. Very easy to use and cofeemaker brews excellent coffee. Also has several useful programmable features.
David Isherwood,1.0,"June 24, 2015","Would be a great coffee maker if the coffee went in the pot instead of the counter.  When brewing, the coffee does not drip into the pot.  Instead, it will run along the underside of where the filter is and drip on the outside of the pot.  I would add a photo if I had remembered to take one before spending 10 minutes cleaning up the office kitchen...again."
Keith,2.0,"December 8, 2012","I had a ""Braun coffee maker"" that after many years died on me. I would have bought another ""Braun"" if they still made them for the USA market. I checked Consumer Reports to see which coffee maker they recommended, and it was this ""Mr. Coffee"" model. I'm very disappointed in the temperature of the coffee from this machine. The Braun made a hot cup of coffee, but the coffee from this machine can be drank straight from the pot without any possibility of burning yourself."
Jim Allen,1.0,"November 15, 2015","The maker works fine.  It's the plastic smell that is a problem.  I've run 10 pots of water through it along with several vinegar washing and it stillsmells of rancid plastic.  The coffee smells the same when made.  I've been leaving it outside in the fresh air, which seems to help.  Not sure it willever lose the odor/taste of the plastic."
nancy,5.0,"January 17, 2013",Consumer Reports gave this coffee maker a high report for the price.  It does have everything I want and it is easy to use. I gave one as a gift and have recieved many satisfactory thanks.  I would recommend it to anyone.
Tammy Olson,5.0,"April 23, 2014","I have been using the Bunn coffee maker for as long as I can remember. When it came time to replace my coffee pot, I thought I would try something different....glad I did. I recommend this coffee maker."
Amazon Customer,2.0,"November 1, 2015",This is my second Mr. Coffee. The first one stopped working after 2 yrs.  I thought I would give it another try since the reviews were pretty good.  This one I have had just over a year (I make coffee everyday for myself) and it just stopped brewing one day.  Disappointed and will try a different brand next time.
jack 24,5.0,"May 29, 2013","We have tried several other brands and models but this is the one to buy.  Very reasonably priced, easy to use and makes good coffee.  Its not more complicated than that."
Cathy,5.0,"August 21, 2016","Nice style love the filter and brew strengths, if you pour over ice use strong brew, very happy with purchase!"
hussler,2.0,"December 6, 2013","PURCHASED MAINLY BECAUSE OF PRICE. GAVE 2 STARS ONLY BECAUSE OF APPEARANCE. LOOKS GREAT ON COUNTER. THIS UNIT HAS A ELECTRONICS ISSUES. DID NOT WORK PROPERLY FROM THE START. BREW SELECTION WOULD NOT WORK. BREW DONE BEEP FEATURE WOULD SOUND OFF 30 SEC. INTO BREWING CYCLE. I NORMALLY TAKE NEGATIVE COMMENTS IN REVIEWS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, BUT THIS MODEL HAS ELECTRONIC ISSUES SO LISTEN TO THE 156 BAD REVIEWS ON THIS ONE!!! RETURNING STUFF IS NOT A PLEASURE BUT AMAZON MAKES IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE. THANKS FOR MAKING IT EASY AMAZON. ORDERED A HAMILTON BEACH AND HOPEFULLY A LITTLE MORE CASH WILL BUY ONE THAT WORKS."
Phil,5.0,"April 13, 2014","I have had all the high priced makers, and unless you want the Taj Mahal of makers, I found this to be just right for a reasonable cup or two of coffee."
Helen Keller,5.0,"November 21, 2012",This coffeemaker is a good quality machine; it makes coffee ahead of time whenever you want and is preprogrammable; it was one of the recommended ones from a consumer magazine.
natalia,5.0,"February 4, 2015","It looks nice, it runs nice. I use to have the same coffee maker before for 4 years, and I broke it by mistake, I liked it that's why I bought the same one.Who is saying that the water smells like plastic, yes, you are right...but it smells like plastic only when you leave the water inside for a long time. I refill the water when I want a coffee or a tee and I do not have any problems with the smell."
kiki,4.0,"September 20, 2014","I love this coffeemaker, it works perfectly, looks nice and is the right price. My coffee is ready for me when I come down in the morning!"
jjmcd97,5.0,"May 8, 2015",Great coffee maker that is easy to program and works exactly as I would expect.  Looks nice as well.  Very happy with this purchase!

27E_20,1.0,"July 3, 2015",Should have read more of the reviews.  Horrible plastic taste despite numerous cleaning attempts.
Lynn Harrison,4.0,"January 16, 2015",Love this coffee brewer. Some of the presets were a little hard to figure out....but overall I like this machine and it makes good coffee.
Alex,1.0,"September 23, 2015",If you're lucky your coffee will only taste like plastic. It'll probably end up being burned though
G. Howell,2.0,"October 22, 2015","I like strong coffee and when set to strong the coffee got burnt, not happy"
Timothy Ward,4.0,"July 14, 2015","Pretty cheaply made, but does the basic job for my office."
april Knight,3.0,"March 28, 2017","Didn't last a year, which I've never had problems with this brand"
Leny,1.0,"September 29, 2015",I was completely satisfied with the product until it suddenly broke (three months after buying it)... bad move Mr Coffee.
Lily’s personal assistant,5.0,"April 15, 2014",Brews hot delicious coffee.  Love the filter.  I use a metal basket and it works great.  Love the automatic turn off - great if you have older parents.
Amazon Customer,1.0,"March 5, 2016","Our new Mr. Coffee coffee maker was delivered Dec. 14, 2015.  Was used exactly 88 times.  I picked this unit model specifically due to its excellent rating on Consumer Reports.  Stunning FAIL.  Heating element completely quit this morning.  I am a less than happy  consumer!  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047Y0UQO/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0"
Bill H.,5.0,"June 26, 2014","Don't know where all the negative reviews come from on this coffee maker.There is no bad smells,and makes a good pot of coffee in about 10 minutes.You can't get much better than that."
Sarah Boston,4.0,"April 13, 2014","So far this handsome coffee maker is doing the job just fine. Everything works, the lights are pretty, the ""chrome"" finish is nice. The only thing i missed was this uses disposable filters, or you have to buy a filter basket."
CaseyL1986,5.0,"December 13, 2014","Love this coffee maker!  It filters the water, which makes a big difference... and is very easy to use.  You also have option of using a thermal coffee pot!"
T. Sassano-Reid,4.0,"June 10, 2014","Does a nice job making coffee. You can use the glass or metal, thermal type. How ever, if you like stronger coffee you need to reset each brewing."
Customer,3.0,"January 29, 2014","It's overpriced, has too many parts I've never seen on a coffee maker before which need to be replaced to make a tasty pot of coffee so the instructions say. What bugs me is if you choose not to purchase individual charcoal water filters and other plastic parts essential to the ""system"" it will be hard to brew a pot without them. what happened to interchangeable parts that you could replace if something was broken or lost. Too cheap to be fancy. Its just coffee. Just my thoughts on the subject."
RON+ CJ,5.0,"November 25, 2015","We Love it!!!  my Hamilton Beach took  43 mins. to brew a pot. This one , 10 mins. today, great coffee!"
gritzgirl,5.0,"June 23, 2014",WONDERFUL..much better than costly  cuisinart which i loved but which quit working after two years...works perfectly...and looks very good too...
R. Gilmore,5.0,"August 30, 2013",works great. set it up the night before and catch a few extra zzs in the morning. no worries about leaving it on too long either.would recommend to anyone.
Beatrice B.,5.0,"October 6, 2016",I haven't figured out how to program it yet but it works real good
Ask Mom,5.0,"April 25, 2015",Best pour spout ever! I bought this as a replacement to an expensive coffee maker at the office. What a pleasant surprise! Nice features and compact.
Martin Weigel,1.0,"May 12, 2016","Stopped working after owning it for 6 months.  Mid-pot, just stopped brewing.  How lame is that!Update!  I did online chat with Mr. Coffee and they are sending me a replacement - no charge!"
Jeff in Missouri,2.0,"October 6, 2016","Junk, just go to Walmart and buy a cheap one cause that's what this one is."
Koddee,3.0,"March 4, 2016","Average, at best.  Coffee tastes like - well, coffee.  For home use - I make one or occasionally two cups at a time.  It is fairly quiet, but will occasionally make a louder gurgling sound near the end of the brew cycle...?  Main dislike is the water filter - I already have filtered water, so don't need the water filter.  However, if you take the filter out, the spray nozzle causes the coffee grounds (at least when making one cup) to push to edge of filter and coffee comes out very weak - have to start over.  This product may work fine when brewing a whole pot of coffee, but for my purposes, I would not buy this product again."
MZ MARY,5.0,"October 4, 2015",This coffee pot is your average coffee pot.  It is programmable and works well.  It is very simple to use.
David  Owens,3.0,"January 7, 2015","We'd had this coffee maker about a year and it worked just fine until the other day, probably just past the warranty date, but then it wouldn't start. We checked everything we could. It just wouldn't work any more. It's bad enough that we had instant junk, but we also had to do without our morning coffee. That's serious!"
Francis,5.0,"May 29, 2013","This item arrived when promised, was well packaged and therefore undamaged. The price is reasonable, and the coffee comes out perfect every time. I Recommend this product."
Mike Henry,1.0,"July 4, 2015","This is by far the worst designed coffee maker we have ever had! No matter how you set up the filter basket, you always have coffee grounds in thepot. Do not purchase!"
mrmcc916,2.0,"August 12, 2015",works great but after 8 months of use 3  times a week the glass pot broke up at the top.  I had made 10 cups and it broke.Hopefully they will replace it but somehow I doubt it.Would be five but the glass pot breaking where the glass and upper handle join is is just bad.
Cowboybob,5.0,"September 23, 2016",Excellent coffee pot.  Use it almost every day with good results.
Albert L. Buerkel,1.0,"October 25, 2015","Worked fine for 2 months, then wouldn't shut off and had to unplug it. Next came home and it had turned itself on. Last it just wouldn't turn on. Expect more than 2 months out of a coffee maker."
Robert T. Uemura,5.0,"October 29, 2013",CONSUMER REPORT SAYS THIS IS THE BEST MR. COFFEE FOR THE PRICE AND ONLY THIS MODEL AND NUMBER.  AMAZON ALSO STOCK THIS ITEM AND WAS SO HAPPY THEY DID.  PERFECT COFFEE EVERY TIME!

M. Damone,5.0,"December 14, 2014",Love my coffee pot but i have yet to figure out how to program.  My fault only.. Will have to read book.. Not self explainitory..
Armed Citizen,4.0,"March 24, 2015","Still haven't quite figured out what the strong brew setting actually does differently (I can't tell that it is any stronger).  Otherwise, it is a good coffee maker that is pretty easy to use"
Honest Review,5.0,"March 14, 2015",I've had the coffee maker for about a month. No bad smell or anything negative. Makes a good cup of coffee and keeps it hot. I'm happy so far.
Jerry G. Cole,2.0,"June 27, 2014",I bought this coffee maker because of the ratings on Consumer Reports.  I stopped making coffee after 2 or 3 months.  My wife cleaned it up and got it working again.  The window is now fogged up.  Based on our experience I would not recommend to anyone.  Sad!!
Traveler.,5.0,"February 17, 2014",I'm kind of a coffee snob (go ahead and laugh - I'll never know!)  I bought this based on the Consumer Report rating and it is excellent. For me - just the right temperature and I like the feature for making Dark Roast.
Molly,5.0,"July 26, 2014",Love the fact that I can get up in the morning and my coffee is already for me.  Very easy to program.  Would definitely recommend it to friends and family.
L. Brown,4.0,"November 6, 2015",I've only used it a few times.  Seems to work fine.  Takes about 10 minutes to make a full pot.  The features are very handy.
William Li,5.0,"June 9, 2015","Works great.  I love it.  I bought it on sale and would buy it again.  Simple with many features, and does its job without complaints.  It's fast too."
Amazon Customer,4.0,"October 7, 2014","Sometimes if you don't put the pot in just right the water won't drain down into the pot. After having that happen a few times I just make sure to check everything after I set it in the night. Other than that, it works great."
Rez,4.0,"September 20, 2013","He's simple, quick and effective. Just wish the water level indicator was on the other side, and the time would have a light up LED behind it or something."
Samantha Restani,5.0,"February 1, 2015","Love it! It did smell like plastic when I pulled it out of the box, but I ran a cycle with water and vinegar before ever making coffee in it like instructed in owners guide and it doesn't smell anymore and makes great coffee. I haven't had any issues with spills or overflowing with the basket. It's a great product especially for the price!"
JC,4.0,"June 18, 2014","I've had the coffee pot for a couple of months and it makes me coffee every morning without a problem. I don't so much like all the lights, though."
Gerald S.,5.0,"December 31, 2014","Works very well, at an unbeatable price. My only slight issue is that the coffee doesn't come out quite as hot as I'm used to."
Sandi,5.0,"February 4, 2015",VERY nice coffee pot forche money....easy to use and makes a pretty good cup of coffee (though not as good as a perculator)
afunk,5.0,"August 14, 2015","Love this coffee pot! Coffee is nice and hot. Easy to program. Easy to fill reservoir.  No drip carafe. Also, I had a lot of trouble with other coffee pots overflowing when brewing because I didn't have the basket in properly.  It just can't happen with this one...it's idiot proof!"
Christopher Peters,5.0,"May 28, 2013","Bought in March.  The delay feature is very easy to use and I love waking up to a full pot.  I also like the brew strength feature, as I always choose ""strong"".  It's easy to clean up as well."

Robert J. Watson,3.0,"March 7, 2015",OK.  Smells of plastic.  Cumbersome to put water and coffee in.  Coffee tastes like plastic but may get better with time.  Makes hot coffee.
family movie night,4.0,"August 24, 2015",It's a coffee pot.  It makes coffee.  just remember to run vinegar through it get rid of the plastic taste.
trekfan,4.0,"October 8, 2011","I've always liked the ""mr coffee"" brand, & this unit isno exception.the only complaints I have are, that my unit dosen't save thestrength setting when it's off, & the display could use abacklight.It makes great coffee, & after all, that's most important.I would definitely recommend this model to a friend.In closing, I think it's a fine machine for the money."
wineknow,4.0,"January 2, 2014",Great coffee maker for the price. It's easy to work and stylish.  the area where you pour the water is large so you don't end up with water all over the place.
Kathryn Helland,2.0,"March 26, 2016","We bought this coffeemaker less than a year ago. It has been used once a day and well cared for.  All of a sudden, it has stopped working.  It lights up, but will not brew.  It has been cleaned.  Nothing appears wrong, but no coffee.  The Mr. Coffee FAQs online are no help.  Color me disappointed."
Dustin E.,1.0,"July 30, 2016",Works fine for a year then the heating element dies. Mr. Coffee replaced the first one after I convinced them that we clean it regularly but we were told it was a one time offer.
DepotCharlie,5.0,"October 10, 2015","Mr. Coffee does it again. Good coffee at an affordable price, including a couple bells & whistles."

ValleyQ,4.0,"December 1, 2013","We purchased Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT because our other coffeemaker dies out on us in least than a year. I read other reviews before purchasing, So far, it's working very well, it keeps the coffee hot for 2hrs. and it still taste great, In addition, it looks very nice on my kitchen counter."
nwilkaz,1.0,"June 30, 2015","We bought a second one and it only lasted 3 months. I am updating this review because after 7 months, it has died.  I can not get it to pump the water through at all.  I have tried vinegar and soaking it to no avail.  I supposed $5 per month for a coffee pot is cheap, but seriously?  I would hope it would last longer than that.Works great.  We've had no issues since our other one died.  I like how easy it is to operate and pour the water.  The filters are nice as well.  There's nothing special about this but it does make some good coffee.d"
LisaB,1.0,"February 27, 2015","My husband is the coffee drinker. I read the reviews about the coffee being ""plastic' flavored, but thought after a good cleaning and running a couple of pots through, that the plastic taste would go away. I didn't mention the review to my husband. He told me, while drinking his first cup, that not only did it smell like plastic, but it tasted like plastic also.  We talked about sending it back and paying 5 times the amount for a ""non plastic"" coffee maker. He is going to give it a week and then decide how much he likes the plastic taste in his coffee."
Jeff F,5.0,"August 16, 2013",Very pleased with this product. Timer even works great. Use it daily with no probems. Love the fact that I can pour a cup of coffee while it is still brewing.
Jennie,5.0,"June 4, 2016",This was purchased for my mom. She's told me several times that she's really enjoying it.
Christopher Robin,1.0,"October 25, 2015",After a few weeks it is now unable to sufficiently heat the water. The coffee is not very hot nor does it have a good taste. I would not recomend this coffee pot to anyone who enjoys coffee on a daily basis. Coffee that is not hot is not worth it.I am especially disappointed that it no long works well after such a short time period.
L. Sabbatini,4.0,"July 30, 2013",Old coffee maker took almost 30 minutes to brew. This one takes less than 10 minutes and the coffee tastes good. Old unit allowed  you to pour water into it without having to pull it out from under the cabinet and I wish this had that feature. Alll-in-all I'm happy with it.
Erin,3.0,"October 6, 2014",The coffee is way too hot and burns very quickly if you don't promptly get it into a carafe. I have used a Mr. Coffee for as long as I can remember and this model has been the most disappointing.
Helga Loney,1.0,"December 7, 2015","The first one I bought from Amazon was defective shortly after one month of usage, and Amazon's underpaid, likely foreign support told me to contact the manufacturer for a replacement. The manufacturer told me the machine was defective due to defective electronics. They replaced it. Not even two or three months later, the next one refuses to brew, and doesn't heat up. Shortly after the boiling plate went up, coffee won't even go through the machine. I expect a full refund either from Amazon or the manufacturer, and if I get any more excuses, I'm going to spread the word about how every defective unit of this Mr. Coffee machine wound up at my door. My grandma does not want to purchase any coffee machines from either Amazon or Mr. Coffee. Send me my money back, or I'm going to file a complaint. I expected better from Amazon, and my last Mr. Coffee was way better than this one, and it lasted more than a year."
Jeff Rexroat,1.0,"February 22, 2016",this item lasted 7 months and is now trash with no eligibility for return
J.G.,1.0,"November 12, 2016",This is the second time I have purchased this type of Mr. Coffee maker. Both times this model lasted only a few months. Other coffee makers have usually lasted me years. Although I love the strong coffee feature I am done with Mr. Coffee products.
milo,1.0,"October 30, 2015",this coffee pot is garbage. it worked beautifully for 3 months and now im looking for another pot as i type. 6 months after i bought it. this thing is garbage
David N,5.0,"December 14, 2013",It is great to set a timer and have fresh coffee in the morning. You can even select between regular and strong brew. Really happy with this selection
Barbie Fort,1.0,"June 5, 2016",Do not buy. This item started a fire in my house in just a month of purchase.
Kent W,5.0,"January 12, 2013","This coffee maker has been wonderful.  The timer is very easy to use.  The display features blue and green LEDs, which makes it look very high-tech.  A bargain for the price."

Stairsteps,1.0,"August 4, 2016","Purchased may2016....  Its aug. 4th,2016....it no longer works"
RAH,5.0,"April 9, 2013",Makes good coffee and is very easy to use.  Also has a activated carbon filter that sits on top of the filter for cleaner water if that is important to you.
Samantha Schulz,1.0,"November 29, 2015","I am usually a huge fan of Mr. Coffee coffee makers, I like it simple and they are usually dependable, mine lasted less than 2 months, until mr. Coffee gives me another one I am giving them one star.  This kind of appliance should be lasting years not months."
Twy,5.0,"January 31, 2014","This coffee maker is worth the money. Honestly, I would have paid more for it. It was delivered fast and in great packaging. It also has a very sleek modern look. It has options to brew your coffee regular or strong. My coffee tastes amazing every time."
Amazon Customer,3.0,"May 28, 2017",Great coffee maker but the heating element under the pot doesn't work well so it doesn't keep the coffee hot for long.
NCBean,5.0,"December 25, 2015","Amazing for the price, and the right price for a drip coffee maker. Other companies are charging 3-4 times as much for the same features--delay brew, brew-strength settings, water filter--but since all drip coffee makers start making sour-tasting coffee as soon as their seals age, why would you spend $100 or more?? On top of being the right price, this machine is a good size (not too big), is shiny and looks sleek on the counter. Very easy to set up. The ""stainless steel"" is a plastic coating that *may* chip off eventually (but if it does, by then, we'd likely be ready to replace it anyway)."
Happycamper,4.0,"October 9, 2013","CR rated it tops ... it works well, but the silly carbon filter unit is worthless.  Coffee makers die quickly, but this one seems to be holding up."
Aaron Wagner,5.0,"August 29, 2013","Have used this coffee maker for about 3 weeks and its everything that CU said it would do-make coffee. All kidding aside it makes a great cup of coffee ,looks great and has numerous options that are simple to use if you so desire. I cannot be more satisfied, it looks like a much more expensive coffee maker. Would highly reccommend this product."
Yellow Dog,2.0,"July 13, 2016",This is the worst coffee maker I have ever had.  About half of the time it does not finish brewing.  Consistently it will only brew one of six cups.  You have to turn it off and on until it brews the correct amount of cups.  This happens using the timer as well.
Tman,3.0,"October 9, 2017",Works good plastic taste was nearly impossible to go away in the beginning. Months later it's gone and coffee tastes good.
DAJ,5.0,"November 4, 2013","This is a great coffee maker, it's easy to program.I like that it turns itself off in a couple of hours, in case we forget. Coffee turns out good"
Brenda Segneri,5.0,"May 28, 2015",This is an excellent coffeemaker. It was recommended on Consumer Reports. Everything about it is well-designed. I am thrilled with my purchase!
Amazon Customer,4.0,"February 4, 2013","I could do with out all of the programming features as we all get up at different times different days, however It makes a great cup of coffee and fits nicely under the cabinets."
Harrison S Reed III,5.0,"June 28, 2014",Mr. Coffee makers do a good job of brewing my morning coffee. Their longevity is adequate especially considering having a heater element.
Earl Williams,5.0,"December 30, 2014",The Mr. Coffee maker is great.  easy to use and makes great coffee and it keeps the coffee in the carafe nice and hot.
James M.,1.0,"October 22, 2014","This Coffee maker lasted 3 months and then stopped working.  I took it apart to clean and look for obvious problems.  There were none.  It simply is not pulling water up the tube out of the reservoir and not worth diagnosing any further.I never had the bad plastic taste or smell from the other bad reviews, but it does not matter much any more.Don't ignore the 300+ 1 star reviews like I did."
Rosalie K. Doss,5.0,"August 18, 2013","This was a gift for my son-in-law,and I had it sent to him and he was amazed at how well it was packaged,and the quality of the product.He loves it!"
Iva Griffin,5.0,"July 28, 2013",Love this coffee pot.  Love the price of this coffee pot.  Replaced my Bunn that had a seal that was leaking and was told to return the coffee pot to the manufacturer and they would send me a $64 certificate toward a new one.  New one cost $105 and by the time I paid shipping old one to them and got certificate not that much saved so checked consumer magazine and they rated this one as good as the Bunn and I agree with them and it is a best buy.....
Marco A. Rodriguez,1.0,"June 18, 2016",Just quit working worked one morning then not the next. I called and they gave me a FREE replacement but the return shipping which they didn't pay for cost almost as much as the coffee maker.
Tiffany Ouyang,1.0,"January 16, 2016","As I used this machine for the first time, the water wouldn't go through the spout.  The whole machine just over heated, steamed up, and no water came down.  It worked a few times afterwards, but after the 3rd week of using it, it did the same thing again.  It just doesn't work."
Bev Spar,1.0,"March 20, 2017",we have had this coffee pot since Feb 2016. No it doesn't work?? Only lasted a little over a year & in that time we were gone for 3 months. Not happy at all about how long this coffee pot worked. Our last coffee pot lasted for over over 30 years.The other thing is I can't find who to contact about this issue??
Linda F. Greenberg,5.0,"March 30, 2013",I enjoy coffee and really dislike any burnt taste.  This coffee maker makes perfect coffee and no burnt taste if it sits in the carafe for a while.  Linda
LS,5.0,"January 9, 2015","Only downfall is that the sight bar for how much water you are pouring in is on the side, so it requires you to turn the coffee maker to measure the amount of water."
Joan Giese,5.0,"July 22, 2014",I was surprised by this coffeemaker.  It is the best Mr. Coffee I have ever had.  I love the replaceable filter system because it improves the taste of my coffee.
Michael E. Cole,5.0,"January 11, 2014","Easily programmed, which is the reason I got rid of my old maker, doesn't take too long to make a pot and if you forget about it, it will turn itself off."
Amazon Customer,5.0,"September 17, 2016",3 months using this has paid for itself with all the Starbucks I don't need to get anymore.
David Gonzalez,5.0,"January 23, 2014",This is a great coffee machine for anyone who wants to have more than just one cup or if you have room mates and everyone is clambering for the machine. I ordered this with the filters too and it was great to not have to worry about buying a bunch of those for the next two years!!
Jeff'nAbi,4.0,"April 15, 2015","Stays clean and works freat. Love the large reservoir to fill the water. Very easy to use.  The ""strong"" option is ideal."
John,5.0,"September 22, 2015",This coffe pot works great.  At first the coffe was too weak.  I now make it with the strength setting to strong and I love it.
Elizabeth McKinney,5.0,"April 23, 2014","I did my research on line to find the best coffee pot.And this coffee machine was recommended, so far it has lived up to its reviews"
Mary A. Norris,4.0,"September 4, 2015","So much more options; stronger for me and weaker for hubby, pauses just right, water filter ensures great taste,turns off automatically and easy to clean! The only part that didn't earn it five stars is the silver trim. I am afraid it may peel of over time?! Happy coffee enthusiast!"
Sparky,2.0,"November 26, 2016",I worked well for about a year. Lately the water hasn't been getting very hot.
Dr. Steven E Gray,2.0,"April 2, 2017","This product worked fine for one week more than a year! The next day, it brewed okay but did not keep the coffee hot and the next day, would not heat up to brew nor was the warming plate hot. While it was working, I did not have a complaint, but this did not last."
M T Smith,5.0,"June 10, 2014",This is the best coffee maker I have bought for a long time. I had a more expensive coffee maker before and Mr coffee is the best.
Whiteletters,5.0,"January 5, 2014","I got this coffee pot for $25, and it makes good coffee. I haven't had any problems. I have only had it for a month, so I can really speak to the longevity of the product. But I got a coffee maker with a timer for a pretty good price, so I am happy. I would recommend this product to a friend."
Stacy Cox,5.0,"October 19, 2015",purchased several months ago and it still working. my Hamilton Beach didn't last this long.
john o. case,2.0,"September 7, 2013","The coffee taste like the plastic its made from, it has a strong smell and taste like the smell of the maker it self. The coffee is not as hot as could or should be. I think CONSUMER REPORTS RATING LET US DOWN........... I think we will be looking for a new coffee maker soon."
G. C. Hartsoe,3.0,"February 8, 2014",The user manual did not indicate that in order to set the clock and delay brew time it would be necessary to use a flashlight to view the time because there was no back lighting nor were the numbers lighted. After calling Mr. Coffee customer service I was informed that the model coffeemaker I chose did not come with a lighted clock. Had I known this I would have chosen different model.

Donna & Donald,3.0,"September 15, 2015",Love it. Will have been 5 stars if the lid on top opened from the front instead of the side. Also the time doesn't light up making it impossible to read.
L. C. Copeland,2.0,"July 8, 2017","I've purchased two of these Mr. Coffee branded coffee makers in the past 5 years for myself and now the second one is leaking water from underneath the unit.  The first item just quit working one day after about 2 years of no problems.  I had purchased the steel carafe with it for keeping the coffee warm without the hot plate so I decided to buy another identical product for that reason.  Now after 3 years my second Mr.  Coffee leaks water so you get a mess even when brewing immediately after filling with water.  Delayed brewing would be a water disaster.  I won't be buying a Mr. Coffee brand unit again.  I give my two coffee makers 2 stars vs, 1 star for lasting over 2 and 3 years respectively.  By the way I never noticed the strong chemical smell that many have reported."
Jeff G.,4.0,"June 25, 2015","Not bad. But if you want HOT coffee, you'll have to nuke it for a little bit."
Cindy Ladd,5.0,"August 29, 2014","Better than my Gevalia coffee maker. I can use less coffee, hit the ""strong"" brew button, and it comes out great!"
Donna,5.0,"January 8, 2013","i guess my daughter and boyfriend love it ,never see them with out a cup of coffee in thier hand so they must! It got here before Christmas so that was good!"
Shirley,5.0,"March 21, 2014",This reasonably priced coffee maker does it all.  I haven't tried the delayed start yet but have confidence that it wil work as well.
Kelly Nelsen,5.0,"January 18, 2013",Bought this for my husband for Christmas after previously owning a Kerug. He likes the fact you can make many cups at one time instead of the single cups. Great machine!
Anthony Jimenez,5.0,"August 18, 2013","I bought this coffee maker as a gift for my parents after their old one started leaking and I must say I am much more than pleased with it. The coffee made in this machine is excellent, no plastic taste as some other reviews have said. I love the option of choosing regular or strong coffee. If you need a brilliant coffee maker for an excellent price then buy this one!!!"
mybluecastle,4.0,"June 23, 2013",I got this to replace a previous Mr. Coffee and so far have been pleased. I like the option to use the thermal pot though I have not done so. It's easy to use and takes up minimal space on my countertop!
Kindle Customer,2.0,"July 18, 2014",5 months later this coffee maker takes 30-35 min to make 12 cups of coffee. I will not use another mr coffee of this model. only bottled or filtered water has been used in this maker. I have used mr coffee makers for years may not buy them again..
S. Lieb,5.0,"June 19, 2014","Works great & I love it because if you forget to turn it off you don't have to worry, it automatically turns off after 2 hours."
Can I Help You?,5.0,"October 25, 2015",Makes great coffee - is easy to use and easy to clean. Great coffee maker for the price!
Carlos Perez,5.0,"January 12, 2013",I purchase this coffee maker because it was the best rated by consumers report. I definitely like this coffee maker it is simple but delivers all the time and consistently for the price you can not beat it.
Heather Walker,3.0,"February 9, 2015","It's a fine coffee maker. I was on a quest for a truly hot cup of coffee and this doesn't quite deliver, but it's fine. I won't replace it."
John Brown,5.0,"May 7, 2015",I use this daily and the programming is super easy to figure out. No complaints with this model at all.
Kindle Customer,4.0,"October 23, 2014","works and performs well. This was a replacement for my previous on, which lasted over 5 years before the carafe cracked"
Tomzap O'Brien,5.0,"January 15, 2017",much better than the costco Mr Coffee version that it replaces
Paratus,5.0,"October 19, 2015",Nice design!  Don't use the programmable feature so cannot comment on the functionality.
Kindle Customer,5.0,"September 28, 2014",Purchased this for my two daughters away at college and they love it - They like being able to control the brew strength - apparently stronger is better :)
AnnieRundle1222,5.0,"December 20, 2014",Does exactly what it should do.  Make a good cup of joe.  My son knows when coffee is ready!  It beeps to let you know.  Great buy
Becca N,1.0,"February 29, 2016","I've only had it for about a week but so far it's worked wonderfully. I don't notice the plastic smell some other reviews had mentioned. It's easy to set the delay brew. The coffee is the perfect temperature and still tastes fresh if you leave it on the heating plate for a little while. I also bought a Mr. Coffee permanent filter which has been great.Edit: I've had this for about a month and the coffee has gotten extremely weak. I use the strong option and there is no difference. I'm using 4.5-5 scoops for 2 cups of coffee, which entirely too much. Even with all that, the coffee still tastes like dirty water. When I first started, the coffee maker was taking 5-7 minutes, not it takes about a minute and a half. I'm assuming this is why it tastes so terrible. I wish I had never bought this. Waste of money."
TA,5.0,"November 4, 2015",Has been working well for a while now and haven't heard any complaints from the in-laws that it was purchased for.

C,1.0,"March 7, 2015","Product looks nice. Arrived DOA. After plugging in the appliance and it does not brew. All lights and the clock work fine but it does not pump any water into the filter basket. Don't even hear it warming the water. Extremely disappointed, hopefully Amazon replacement will work when I receive it."

David B,3.0,"March 12, 2014",I don't notice a difference between the strong and normal brew strengths on this coffee maker.  I was surprised by the amount of coffee grounds needed to produce 4-5 cups of coffee.  I prefer the taste of Keurig coffee to anything I was able to produce from this coffee maker.  I will say you can't beat the price of this coffee maker though.  I might just be really bad at brewing coffee.
AJ Kurpjuweit,3.0,"March 10, 2017",Great when it works.  I would expect it to last longer than 16 months though.  Disappointing.
Eric Hazel,3.0,"April 21, 2016","Ordered this coffee maker as a Christmas gift in Dec 2015 but after owning it just a few mos the coffeee maker stopped brewing and the heat plate won't heat up which was a major disappointment. I will say I did call Mr. Coffee and they were wonderful, sending out a replacement at no charge and hoping this one lasts many years."
NYUDoc04,5.0,"January 14, 2014",For a coffee maker this price  - this thing is awesome.  Watch the height but other than that - very simple to use and cost efficient.
Anon,1.0,"March 17, 2016",Lasted less than 7 months before it broke.  We make coffee once a day and it stopped pumping water up to the grounds.
Stephen Verdini,1.0,"January 25, 2016","I'm so disappointed! The coffee machine was delivered Friday, used once, and now won't brew coffee! The green light is on and everything looks like it's ready to go, but it won't brew!"

BDA,5.0,"December 13, 2014","Had to replace our Cuisinart, and saw that the reviews on this coffee maker were top notch. My father also has one and like it.Great coffee maker with everything you need. Once again, proof you don't have to pay top dollar to get a quality product."
Tri,5.0,"December 17, 2011",This has some nice features -it can even tell if you are using the carafe or the glass pot.  I like that this is black and chrome too - it won't show coffee stains the way our old off white coffee maker did. It also has built in cord storage. Makes a good cup of coffee too!
cynthia wiles,5.0,"January 8, 2015",Love this coffee maker. Consumer reports ranked high so I gave it a chance. Can't go wrong for 25-30$
James,5.0,"August 15, 2015",Product is just what I wanted well made. Makes a great cup of coffee with no after taste.
Kyle DeWees,2.0,"February 15, 2014",I recently got this for my office and have realized that when you empty the basket you've got to put it back in a certain way otherwise the machine clogs until you either burn yourself moving the basket or you just let it spray hot coffee everywhere until it gets through with the cycle. Not great for trying to make a quick pot of coffee at the office.

FatterChance,4.0,"May 26, 2014","Standard drip coffee. Quality depends on beans, roast and grind. Otherwise, this device is quick, easy to clean, keeps coffee warm, etc."
Brent,1.0,"October 25, 2016","Worked okay for 1 year but now the unit comes on and will not brew, seems other people have had this issue and they have it listed on their website as a FAQ...seems to happen to a lot of people.

Roy E. Nielsen,2.0,"May 31, 2011","I read all of the customer comments about this coffee pot and I just didn't want to try anything other than a Mr Coffee unit.  I can now concur with the negative remarks that other purchasers made about the pot dripping all over the place.  I tried pouring from extra slow to very fast with no success.  After I removed the pot cover, I was able to pour a cup without making a mess.  I am very disenchanted with Mr Coffee for selling something like this although I will never have to buy a practical joke dribble cup, I've got the whole dribble pot,  I will be buying a second pot very soon and it will not be a Mr Coffee type.  I am almost convinced that if I want the benefit of a well made coffee unit, I should perhaps buy a Bunn.  They do not leak."

At the Hearth,2.0,"February 25, 2015","Returned this product.  Too many lights (who needs their kitchen to look like an airport runway?)  Also, it overflowed on the first trial.  I did keep the stainless steel carafe which I ordered as an accessory, and the metal basket filter.  Love both of those."
Clams Casino,4.0,"August 5, 2013","We had a Krups that cost twice as much and NEVER seemed to work properly. Two years later, it broke down. This model was rated so highly, I ordered it immediately and couldn't be happier with my purchase.It's simple to use. We love that it's compatible with a glass or thermal carafe. Coffee comes out hot and tastes great. Absolutely no complaints !"

Chas,2.0,"March 13, 2014","I was excited to get this highly rated coffee maker.  It did not live up to the reviews.The first one I received would not hold the ""strong brew"" setting.  I returned it. The second one I received also doesn't hold the strong brew setting.  Perhaps it was operator error?  It was not.On the plus side, it keeps the regular brew coffee warm and drinkable for a long time.  Easy to clean."
Amazonian,5.0,"September 9, 2014","Nice coffeemaker. After 3 months, it quit working. Mr. Coffee shipped me a new one in advance of receipt of the defective one.It is nice to see that this company honors their warranty. They paid for the return shipping also."

Elleni,4.0,"May 13, 2018","This coffee maker makes great coffee, but the problem I have with the filter Shape is oval not circle which is inconvenient."
Robin Snyder,5.0,"December 13, 2015",This has been great.  It is easy to program for timed brews and the buttons on the display are easy to follow.We only use it with a glass pot but it is nice to know that a thermal pot could be used too.  The strong brew coffee function is a favorite of my husband as well.  I like that the water spout swivels so that you can move it out of the way when adding water or coffee to the pot.  It takes ~7-8 minutes to brew a fun pot but the interrupt function makes it so that you can easily grab a cup in the middle of the brew without making a mess.
Sande Clement,5.0,"November 8, 2013","Great features. Can choose between regular or strong brew.  Signals when coffee is ready, and also when it automatically shuts off in two hours, if not shut off manually."
Amazon Customer,5.0,"September 6, 2017",Very good.
E. Flagg,5.0,"December 3, 2011","We really like this coffee maker, the controls are clear and simple, it brews quickly, and looks great too. I think I saw the same product at Target, perhaps an even better price, so something to think about."
J. Johnson,5.0,"July 18, 2014","Thank you, Consumers Reports for once again making the choice clear. This produces piping hot coffee at a bargain price. It's so good I am buying a second one as I noticed the coffee it makes is much better than I was getting from my ancient coffeemaker."
David Skillings,1.0,"January 27, 2016",Had it for about a year and it stopped working. Other said the same thing. Should of gone with their review. So now it is in the trash. Waste of money

Christine C. Ashley,5.0,"February 6, 2013","Love my Mr Coffee 12 cup programmable coffeemaker. Had a Cuisanart that ground the beans and was programmable, and had to return it for exchange twice (I had bought it for my three kids, and they all had to return theirs at least once), and when it refused to grind the beans, I gave up and went back to Mr Coffee. And the price was so much better than others that I researched online."

Robert H Nice,1.0,"March 14, 2016",Worked fine for 3 months then died. Won't heat water anymore. I bought this one to replace a Bunn that I had for 8 or more years. Thought I'd try a Mr. Coffee instead of paying the higher price. Learned my lesson. Going back to a Bunn
CM,5.0,"April 1, 2013",Great coffee maker for my brother.  He said it is thebest one he has ever owned. So I guess that testimonialspeaks for itself.

Amazon Customer,1.0,"April 15, 2016","Having a few difficulties with this coffee machine. Happened on 4 different occasions where the water is trying to filter through, but it will not drip in the coffee pot. It starts accumulating all the water on the coffee filter and it starts to overflow."
AmazonAJ,5.0,"December 22, 2014","I really have no complaints about this product. It is simple to use and has some advanced features like delay start,clock display, auto off and brew strength. I've been using it for about a month now and it is making great hot coffee with no major issues. It looks good and doesn't take up much space. For the price what more can or do you expect. Even if it lasts a year or two I will have gotten my money's worth."

vferne48,4.0,"April 18, 2013","This is a great Coffeemaker ,I have used MR Coffee for years and find the easy to clean and to set up for your morning coffee .One thing that I am not happy with is that all the Mr Coffee makers I have used ,I find that the spouts have a habit of dripping a little when pouring. Not a problem ,but annoying . Otherwise the makers are reliable ,long lasting and through Amazon the prices are always reasonable . You can get different colors too !!!"
Paul Trinh,4.0,"August 22, 2013","This thing is tall. I have to pull it forward away from underneath my cabinets to open the lid. But it works well, and produces a great cup of coffee. There is an annoying beep that sounds off 3 times in a row when your coffee is done. Its extremely loud in my house, could possibly wake my sleeping babies...so i returned it due to that, it's height, and me realizing I didnt need 12 cups after all."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"January 29, 2017",Cleaned it just like the manual said used it twice and then it quick working all together. After finding out that this is a common problem I wrote Mr coffee to express my concern and disatisfaction of the product and was told sorry for the inconvenience.  Don't waste your money spend the money on a crux
Nicholas Miller,1.0,"March 29, 2016",I bought this pot in September and have used it everyday. It worked well until it just stopped working completely. It plugs in and the lights come on but the buttons do nothing and the pot doesn't operate. Really disappointed.

Wopantherfan,4.0,"August 2, 2014",I just wanted a basic machine that gives me hot coffee every morning and after one week I'm satisfied.  The positives: It brews quietly and the temperature of the coffee is perfect.  I also like that it doesn't overwhelm my counter space.  It's a nice compact machine.  Not a big deal but it does drip a bit if you use the carafe during brewing and the beeps at the end are unnecessary and annoying.
It’s Bear,3.0,"October 29, 2011","Great coffee maker for the price, nice design, accurate water gauge, easy pour, the whole bit you'd expect from a $30 home coffee maker.  BUT THAT TASTE!!!!  It cannot be overstated.....WASH THIS COFFEE MAKER 5 TIMES OR MORE OR IT WILL TASTE LIKE METAL AND RUBBER!  After 3 clean cycles, 2 pots of coffee dumped down the drain, a few bad tastes in the mouth and finally a clean cycle with some vinegar......yes the coffee now tastes great.  I'm sure in a few weeks the early stumble will be forgotten with this product but remember if you buy it, clean it, clean it, clean it!!!!"

Megan,5.0,"December 10, 2015","I LOVE my coffee maker. I've used a fancy tea pot for making coffee for years. I've also used that thing where you put the filter above the cup and pour hot water directly above it for a few years. I finally broke down and got a real coffee maker and it's amazing.It has a water filter so I can put icky sink water into it and it filters out the bad stuff like a filter in your water pitcher in your fridge. I also bought the permanent filter, so life is good. I like using the timer setting so when I wake up the coffee is already made. Ah, so good!"

el bob-o gato,1.0,"August 11, 2016",There are too many gadgets and things to deal with every time you make coffee. It is very aggrivating first thing in the morning. If you don't do 1 of the 4 tasks before the coffee brews you have coffee all over your counters. Not a simple machine.

PapaKen,4.0,"January 13, 2012","I bought the coffee maker based on the Consumer Reports review.  I got it to match my other appliances and it does everything I want it to.  It looks good, is easy to operate, brews quickly and beeps when brewing is complete which is nice.  I have to slide it out from the cabinets to add coffee and water because of the height so make sure you have sufficient counter depth to slide it out if that is an issue."
P. Childs,5.0,"July 13, 2014","I bought this Mr. Coffee because Consumer Reports ranked it third highest - after two Cuisinarts that were priced $200 and $100, respectively.

I went to Consumer Reports and they gave this coffee makers the highest rating. She was not disappointed. She loves the coffee it brews. I personally love the auto brewing feature so that I don't have to worry about forgetting to turn it on. It has yet to let me down. I would highly recommend this product.
Ray Jung,1.0,"May 14, 2015","Worst coffee maker I've ever had.  The coffee had a very strong plastic taste.  We also tried it with the 8-cup thermal carafe and the basket style reusable filter, they made a slight difference but still terrible.  After one month we are replacing it with the Mr. Coffee FTTX95-1 10-Cup Thermal Coffeemaker.Do not buy."

I had a fairly new one of another brand but the coffee just didn't taste as good as it did with my old one.  I believe it was because the water didn't get hot enough - something CR rated their coffee makers on.  I bought it on Amazon because the retail stores didn't use the same ID on the pots and I wanted to be sure I got the right one.  I'm very happy with it,\."

Brittany S.,3.0,"February 4, 2016","I really loved this coffee maker...for 18 months.  I didn't have a single complaint....for 18 months.

Seth Richter,1.0,"April 5, 2014","I have purchased several Mr. Coffee machines over the years, and I loved the simplistic designs and cost to value ratio. I had hoped that this trend would have continued over the years, but I guess this was just a statistical inevitability:The mechanism that drips the coffee is triggered by the coffee pot, which causes a spill onto the warming plate every single time. This alone justifies a 1 star rating, because it significantly reduces the machines life, however:I really like the fact that it is easier to pour water into the machine, but the nozzle must be moved every time that coffee grains is added to the machine or when cleaning out the grains. Remember that this is adding onto the constant hassle of needing to endlessly clean spills. I almost forgot one other thing: the ""finished brewing"" sound is largely inaudible beyond 1 room.This machine stands in stark contrast to all of the years of consumer-friendly functional design choices of Mr. Coffee's past, and is a waste of time, space, and money. I gave this thing 1 star, because I will be dumbfounded if the machine lasts even a fraction of time longer than my previous Mr. Coffee. I hope that this isn't a trend for Mr. Coffee, and I hope that they are just off their game. However, I am so disenfranchised with this thing that I will probably stay away from Mr. Coffee products in the future.At $25 this machine is rip-off, and I would say that it would be better priced under $5 as a gag gift."

Karen,5.0,"December 14, 2011",This coffeemaker is great.  Makes very good coffee and is done very quickly.  Just make sure you place the basket correctly or the water won't go down all the way.

Melanie,2.0,"May 19, 2013","you have to place the filter and the filter basket perfectly every time otherwise the filter collapses (and grinds dump into your coffee) or worse, the coffee overflows.I have owned coffee makers for 30 years-this one is too 'finicky'-one shouldn't have to be so exacting when constructing a morning cup of coffee"

This got rave reviews at Amazon and several tech sites so for the price I took a chance.  Amazingly it makes a better cup of joe than the Cuisinart!  The filter basket, round filter and swing arm were a bit confusing and cumbersome but once I got my glasses on I could see where everything went!  One feature that is nice is that there is a monthly reminder on the basket with a red arrow to remind me to change the round filter."

Shannon Reed,5.0,"January 9, 2014","I had a Keurig, but it broke and I was sick of brewing more than one cup every morning.

The smell of coffee gets me out of bed first thing in the morning, I couldn't be happier with it!"

ROGER BOLT PHOTOGRAPHY,2.0,"October 7, 2014",The unit had a plastic taste we could not get rid of. Gave it away to someone who didn't mind the off flavor.
Kenneth Wagner,2.0,"December 27, 2012",Works mostly. Doesn't properly wet all the grounds. Nice that I can re-pour the coffee thru the grounds & filter as this unit is a bit deficient at fully using the grounds.

Wilma W,2.0,"September 2, 2015","I purchased this machine in May as a replacement for a three year old version of this same model, because our original machine had stopped working. Everything would light up, but it wouldn't brew if you threw it in a vat of yeast and sugar. I loved our old machine, and wanted to stick with something I knew I liked. Now September is here, and I wake up to the sound of my roommate saying ""What the *&^%?"" as he tried to get the coffee pot to brew coffee for me. It is, after less than four months, bound for the landfill. I am pissed, and I'm going to be looking for a new brand of coffee maker, because not being able to count on my coffee pot to make me coffee when I need to go to work in the morning is not going to cut it."

Kim,2.0,"December 5, 2014","Ugh. Didn't even get to brew my first cup. Lid design sucks; lid doesn't come off. Washed the pot, was trying to prop it over before I finished drying it. OF course it fell right to the floor and smashed. Great price, but not as great now that I have to buy a new pot."

I like the programming feature that allows me to set a timer to brew, but the lid opens with just a flimsy plastic bar guide.  Gently raise and lower the lid to prevent breakage.  It is attractive and does the job. It wipes up easily."

Tom Nicholson,2.0,"December 20, 2016",It's easy to spill water when you are pouring water in it. The filter holder is easy to put in in the wrong position which dumps coffee everywhere. It's very easy to mess it up when using it. It's harder to set up than most coffee makers.

Jules,3.0,"January 7, 2015","Pot often doesn't sit ""just right"" on there and leaks everywhere."
Kindle Customer,1.0,"April 26, 2013","This is probably the worst coffee pot we've ever had.  We bought it because Consurmers Reports recommended it.  We use really good coffee and had to load this machine with much more than we've ever used--well over 1 heaping scoop per cup.  Often the grounds seeped through.  Sometimes there was an oily sheen on top,  If you like coffee, don't buy this machine."
Singing dove,5.0,"November 24, 2015",good product
Hawaiian Hillbilly,5.0,"February 2, 2015",MR. COFFEE. NEED I SAY MORE. MAYBE THEY SHOULD MAKE A MRS. TEA FOR TEA?

Chuck,5.0,"January 5, 2013","Very nice coffee maker, it meets my expectations. I just hope it lasts longer than my last Mr Coffee maker.If there is one thing I could change on this device it would be to make the shutoff time 3 hours instead of 2. My last Mr Coffee had the same limitation and I used to turn it back on to keep the coffee pot warm longer. Maybe that is what caused it to stop working."
John,5.0,"May 11, 2012",Good coffee maker.  Easy to understand and well designed.  Makes a good cup of coffee.  Love the delayed start and the fresh brew timer.
S. Lambert,5.0,"May 26, 2016",Works great and looks nice too.
ccm13,5.0,"March 25, 2014",I was looking for a coffee maker replacement.  This fit the bill according to the specs.  it does what it says.
Bernard Crotty,3.0,"June 15, 2013",Mr. Coffee didn't do a good job with this version. It seems cheaply made and the mechanism is a throwback to older models. The previous design for the coffee basket was much more efficient and produced a better cup. This model has a tendency to drip if you remove the pot before brewing is complete. But overall the product is OK and the coffee tastes good.
Jody A. Schrumpf,5.0,"September 10, 2014","Great coffee pot. easy to use, the filters make the coffee taste better. love it"
SAB523,5.0,"November 15, 2013",This is a great coffee pot. Bought this for my grandmother and she has had nothing but good things to say about it. Would recommend this product.

jon h,5.0,"July 21, 2016",works very well.
Terry Schow,5.0,"March 5, 2013",This maker was also highly rated by a consumer rating magazine.  More compact than my last coffee maker?  I like the fact you can also utilize the metal pot and reusable filter (options for purchase)and save on paper filters
"Steven O. Evans, PhD",5.0,"June 24, 2016",Great coffee maker.
Mrs. Carol L. Hammond,5.0,"January 30, 2013",I bought this to replace the last one of the same. This laster longer than any coffee maker I have ever had.

Brodidious,5.0,"November 21, 2015",Makes great cofffee...Mr.Coffee....what else do ya need to know.
Ken,4.0,"December 7, 2015","Complaints: 1) I had to run 3 or 4 pots full of water through it to eliminate the ""plasticy"" chemical smell. 2) About a cup of water gets ""stuck"" in the system. For instance, you fill the line to 8 cups, it makes maybe 7.5. The amount of water that doesn't go entirely through varies, but it's never more than 2 cups. Compliments: 1) It makes coffee. 2) Easy to follow setup and instructions. In the end, it does what we wanted for our team room at the office and if you're just looking for a simple coffee maker to do just that... make coffee, this will get the job done."
Jovigirl,5.0,"August 25, 2015",Excellent my son is very happy with his new coffee maker
sandjo31,4.0,"January 5, 2015",Its my husbands favorite appliance. He loves it better than a keurig
Collin M Dyer,2.0,"November 6, 2013","(1) not very user friendly - took awhile to figure out how to turn it ""on"" and about as simple to program as a  80's vcr...(which is to say, not)(2) coffee is not hot - as evidenced by lack of any steam from a pour - if you like it *HOT* like me look elsewhere.Conclusion:  if you like luke-warm coffee and were a fan of programming VCRs in the 80, this is the machine for u."
W. Matthew Hart,1.0,"December 24, 2017","This coffee maker stop heating after only two months, what a Rip-Off!"
DaveK,4.0,"December 24, 2011","The machine is easy to use, makes good coffee and was a sensible price. I would buy this machine again when my other coffee pots need replacement. We have a Bed & Breakfast business and good tasting coffee for our guests in the mornings is essential."
Kindle Customer,5.0,"May 10, 2015",Our second one.  Purchased in lieu of just the refill carafe.

Scott,5.0,"September 27, 2016",Does what it is advertised to do.
Ryan Matthews,5.0,"January 1, 2015",Brews a great pot of coffee. Purchased to replace a much older model. Excellent price.
Donald V. Rogers,5.0,"October 15, 2011","Makes great coffee in a reasonable amount of time. As with most coffee makers, the 12 cup capacity is for cups the size of shot glasses. It makes six of my favorite coffee mug."
Tim,4.0,"January 30, 2013",Consumer Reports rated this model as one of the better values and we agree after using it for several weeks.Only other comments we would make is that baskets require a little more coffee to be used than our older Cone filter based maker to maintain the same strength of brew...and the place you pour your water in is a little awkward...but fine once you get used to it.
JB,4.0,"June 9, 2013",I bought this coffeemaker because the lid opens from the side. My last coffeemaker opened from the front and water was always rolling down the back of the coffeemaker when I opened it to remove the filter. I also like the option of using a carafe.  The sound it makes when the cycle is complete is also a nice feature.
Chris B,5.0,"February 13, 2015",works great with no issues. this coffeemaker is very dependable.
Carol S,4.0,"May 2, 2015","If the clock had a light so it could be seen, I would give it 5 stars."

lloyd,5.0,"May 19, 2016",love it works great
no name,2.0,"December 13, 2014",I purchased this item because online reviews stated it brewed coffee at a temperature of 195 degrees.  Unfortunately my coffee comes out at a temperature of about 140 degrees.  Had I known this I would not have purchased it.
Sunshine,5.0,"June 7, 2013",I love this coffee maker! It works great and looks very nice also. The price is wonderful for such a great product!
Linda,1.0,"November 4, 2014",I've had 2 of these and neither lasted over a year.  Very disappointing
Candice A Guise,4.0,"November 2, 2013","The coffee is nice and hot and the flavor is good.  The drawback is the control panel on the front.  Setting the timer for coffee or simply turning the coffee on is not self-evident.  The display is hard to read - not lighted and quite small.  We almost sent it back based on the front design, which was poorly thought out."
HighCountryHomesteader,5.0,"February 19, 2013",We bought this for a gift. Works well and as advertised! Coffee maker has everything you need and nothing you don't.
Hidden Name,5.0,"March 1, 2015",Amazing but DON'T use the filter it makes the coffee weaker!
Kendall Funes,1.0,"July 31, 2016",Gave it to goodwill as soon as I tried it
Kindle Customer,5.0,"June 18, 2011","Brews coffee quickly, quietly and the coffee is much hotter than what I got from my previous coffee maker. The warmer plate keeps the coffee nice & hot too. Brews a good cup of coffee, better than a much higher priced big name brand. Easy to set clock, time delay.  Looks better in person than in the online photos. I did have to run several cycles w/ water when it was brand new to get rid of the plastic smell/taste.  Overall great value for the price."
Kim,2.0,"October 8, 2015","Coffee pot works great, I have always loved Mr. Coffee coffee pots.  However 1 time the top wasn't closed all the way and the water went all over the place, my error not a big deal- paper towel to the rescue.  However, the heat from the water stained the silver stripping at the base and it looks awful.  Not sure why hot water would do this but it makes it look old and worn.  I hadn't had it long when this happened and it still bothers me to see this."
jay scherder,5.0,"December 30, 2014",My wife and I love this coffee maker. A great buy for the price.
Gabriela Hernandez,2.0,"July 25, 2015","Eh, my illy coffee tastes mediocre in this machine which is a very bad sign. This is my 2nd machine from amazon that has disappointed me so I'm going to stick with it until someone recommends something better."
Amazon Customer,3.0,"June 4, 2016",Coffee basket is too small and coffee grounds get in the coffee while it's brewing
Barb Walters,5.0,"August 26, 2013",This gem brews excellent coffee. It's simple to program. You can serve from the carafe without spilling a drop. Works better than coffeemakers which cost twice as much.
Katherine Williams,5.0,"November 2, 2015",It is a great coffee maker and we love it.
AGuerra,1.0,"January 7, 2016",I purchased this for my husband's birthday in November.  He only makes coffee on the weekends and drinks 1 or 2 cups.  The machine stopped working by January.  Luckily Amazon let us return it for a refund.

Chris Fisher,5.0,"February 4, 2015","Amazing coffee maker, amazing price!"
todd kruder,4.0,"December 19, 2013","Looked though CR and found this one was highly rated. Our previous coffee maker was also a Mr. Coffee. Lasted seven years with heavy use. For the money this was a great  and are completely satisfied. Only negative would be the manual. Very ambiguous and not very helpful. Fortunately the machine is straight forward, another positive."
Jody Lowman,5.0,"June 23, 2014","The 12-cup programmable coffeemaker is great.  We especially like the hot temperature of the coffee.  There was a slight plastic odor in the beginning, but running a couple of pots of water through the machine cured the smell.  We think that this coffeemaker is a great buy."
Daniel Smoak,1.0,"November 21, 2013","One of the worst coffee pots I have ever purchased.  The water is lukewarm at best and sometimes the entire basket of grounds doesn't even get wet even when on ""strong"" setting.  Have to take pot out, open top, stir grounds to wet entire contents then replace pot to finish brewing.  Can not see the display unless bright lights are on in room."
Tara P.,2.0,"December 27, 2014",This is very noisy and pops and crackles.
sunshinesonata,1.0,"September 5, 2015","Stopped working after 2 weeks of use. The condensation killed the display, too. I was hopeful after reading some positive reviews, but this just didn't work out."
Matthew Mark,1.0,"July 5, 2016","The coffeemaker broke after 5 months of normal use.  The clock works and the light's on, but the unit does not brew. Some googling tells me that this is not out of the ordinary.  Their website tells me to contact a service center for repair, but none of them even exist in my state."
MarkTwain,1.0,"August 3, 2016",Inferior product. Didn't last 8 month. Failed without warning. Worked on Friday. Dead Monday morning.
NJMommy,2.0,"September 28, 2015",I loved this coffee maker until it just stopped working after 6 months.
PaulC,1.0,"July 10, 2016","Bought this at the beginning of 2016, it lasted less than 6 months before dying.  One day it worked, the next day it wouldn't do anything.  Very disappointed.  Won't be buying another one anytime soon"

Dee,4.0,"February 21, 2013",Exactly what we needed to replace the coffeemaker we had.  Makes great coffee and having the choice for stronger is a plus.  Also having the timer to set up the night before gives us a few more minutes to sleep!!!

mw,1.0,"November 13, 2015","DO NOT buy this piece of s***.  It was delivered on 12 Aug 2015 and on 13 Nov 15, it failed miserably.  Now, I have to buy another one and while $$40 won't break the bank, I expect - when I buy a coffee maker - the damned thing should last at LEAST long enough to get a freaking ring in the carafe.  Damn it."
Traciee Alleyne Kirkland,5.0,"August 27, 2014",Good to the Last Drop and always a MUST to begin our day in our home !!!!  Happy Coffee Drinkers Here :-) Super Great Pot !!!!

Barbell2000's opinion,5.0,"December 18, 2015","Great coffee maker.  Make a great hot pot of coffee.  The auto program was easy to do.  I wont necessarily replenish or use beyond the starter pack of charcoal filters that Mr Coffee recommends you use especially since we have really good water to begin with.  It may be a consideration for others if water quality requires additional impurities or taste capture.  In those cases, happy that Mr Coffee provided a way for those folks to enhance their appreciation for a good cup of morning Joe!"
Marlene H. Palmer,3.0,"February 5, 2013",I was not able to program as I wanted. The coffee taste did not meet the expectations that had been advertised.
Nelson Stuart Kasten,5.0,"June 13, 2012","Makes excellent coffee.  For the first few brews had to get over the plastic smell but it eventually dissappeared.  Wish I could turn off the annoying alarm.  Also wish it would remember I want to ""strong"" brew every time, instead of telling it everytime.  All minor complaints.  This is the best coffee maker I've purchased over the past few years.  Would buy it again."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"October 5, 2016",I used this coffee pot one time and moisture somehow got into the digital screen and the delayed brew will not work. It sucks because that is why I purchased this one. Thought maybe once it dried out (which took several days of non use) it would start working..... It didn't .
Succulent Lover,5.0,"September 9, 2016",It makes coffee.
Liz,5.0,"November 23, 2012","I really like this coffee pot.  After a couple pots, the taste of the coffee is really good.  I like it so much I plan to buy another one for our lake home.  Excellent buy for the amount of money it costs.I wish the basket came with it so I did not have to use paper ones.  I will be purchasing one of those metal baskets."

John J,5.0,"February 23, 2013",This coffeemaker won Consumer Reports best coffee maker for a reason.  It's frickin' awesome. I replaced a $100+ machine with this one and I haven't missed the old one one bit. The brew strength option rocks.
Adam White,2.0,"January 23, 2017",Worked great for 14 months and then died. All the lights come on like it's working but nothing happens. Every other coffee maker I've had has lasted for over 7 yrs. and they all cost less.

Stephanie,5.0,"January 18, 2016","Bought this coffee machine a few months ago, being hesitant after reading some reviews.  I love this coffee maker.  Not only does it look nice, but is less bulky on your counter top then some more expensive coffee makers  which is nice if your lacking space like myself.  It doesn't smell like previous post have said, which made me hesitant to buy it.  The coffee stays hot for a while after brewing and has an automatic shutoff function.  Very happy with my purchase."
Rick Powell,4.0,"September 20, 2013","Mr. Coffee has a great reputation for making reliable coffee makers, and this one is no exception.  Features make brewing coffee easy, and allow for customized settings.  A great buy."

Lydia Silva,2.0,"August 31, 2015","This worked for the first month or so, then started overflowing- grounds, coffee not flowing into the carafe but onto the counter and floor. The controls are great but it defeats the purpose if you can't use it."

Magda Laskowski,1.0,"October 6, 2013","It doesn't work; regardless of how much coffee I put in ,the water runs right through it producing watery coffee.

Frenchy,1.0,"April 16, 2012","Found this coffee maker to be very slow. Hard to pour coffee from the pot without dribling all over the counter. Besides that, I ran 10 full pots of water only to try to get the plastic taste out without success. I bought it based on a Consumer Reports review which was rated very high. Another Consumer Reports bogus review."
EJBrea,2.0,"June 1, 2016","Worked alright but crapped out after 9 mos...hot plate and pump seems to be out. Worked fine with almost daily use, glass carafe is nice and timer feature is great. Not sure difference between normal and strong setting (i always used strong)"

player 1,3.0,"March 30, 2013",The unit accumulated a large amount of water on the inside - when you open the top you will see what I mean.Also it appeared that the coffee was not very hot when finished and even letting it sit for a while.

Bruce Bartolomeo,5.0,"April 17, 2013",The Mr. Coffee 12 Cup programmable coffeemaker has become a staple item in our home.  I ordered on a good rating from a consumer magazine.  It has lived up to its hype by providing us with good consistent coffee.  I enjoy the regular and strong brew selection.  It is well worth the price.
Mai,1.0,"March 13, 2014","Coffee made by this coffee maker has strong plastic taste. I washed it with vinegar and water multiple times, but it just didn't go away. Never had this problem with other coffee makers. This was the best looking coffee maker I'd ever bought, which made the worst tasting coffee. Going back."

Amazon Customer,1.0,"September 22, 2016","What a bummer. I bought this coffee machine after reading about it on a few coffee blogs as being the ""best inexpensive coffee maker"" on the market, and that couldn't be further from the truth. When I first opened the machine, the intense odor of plastic was overwhelming and nauseating. I hoped that the smell would go away after I ran a few pots of water through it, but it was to no avail. I even tried running a 50/50 mixture of white vinegar and water through the machine, and it still reeked of melting plastic. That being said, I still decided I should give the pot a go and brew some coffee before making a final decision. I used the recommended measurements from the manual (3 Tablespoons of coffee for 4 cups of water) and the coffee was barely yellow. You could see completely through the pot to the other side. Oh, and it tasted mostly like plastic. I tried brewing a few more pots thinking the grind of my beans wasn't right or I wasn't adding enough coffee and the results were all the same—bad, thin coffee that tasted and smelled more like plastic that it did coffee.My recommendation: Do not buy this machine."
PHYLLIS A TROYER,5.0,"March 7, 2013","After figuring out how to set the time delay, works perfectly.  Never spill the water; easy to fill.  No problems at all like other users described so have to think it is the end user and not the pot.  Haven't really found a coffeemaker that makes really hot coffee like even McDonalds( but haven't tried a Bunn yet)"

Ric,1.0,"September 18, 2016","My wife did not put the filter basket in correctly and made a huge mess. After that it never worked right- just creating a huge amount of steam without hardly any coffee in the pot. I removed the under side and cleaned out all the hoses, check valve ball, and heater element and put everything back- together. Ran vinegar through several times-still just makes a bunch of steam. I hate this thing- brand new and a piece of junk. Now I have to buy another coffee maker because I cannot fix this thing."
J. Showalter,5.0,"January 17, 2013","We love our new coffeemaker! For the price range, it has all the functions of a more expensive maker. It's easy to use and like the look of it on our counter. I appreciated the other review that showed the measurements to consider for the height needed."

Not ecstatic, but satisfied."

Maurie S,1.0,"November 11, 2011","Consumer Reports gave this coffee maker a ""Recommended Buy"". They must have been blind and without a sense of smell. First, the unit is trimmed with a shiny silver color plastic that curves at the bottom. The problem is for any one who has an overhead light in their kitchen. The reflection is like looking into the sun...I'm still seeing spots. Secondly, and the most important reason for my bad rating, is the SMELL of burnt plastic, and other chemical odors coming from the machine. The smell is still around my kitchen and in my nose. I ran water through it 6 Xs, Vineger 2 Xs, and coffee 3 Xs, and the plastic chemical smell is still there. The instructions say to run A Cleaner through it before use. NOTHING IS REMOVING THE ODOR."

One special thing that i like is it will turn itself off after two hours but it will notify you when two hours is up by letting you know by a couple of beeps.

Kindle Customer,3.0,"May 20, 2013","The temperature of the coffee in not hot enough. The brewed coffee is not strong enough, given the type and quality of ground beans I use.  The strength of the coffee may well be connected to the low temperature of the water used to brew it"

Paul Sommer,3.0,"March 5, 2015","Doesn't compare to an older Mr. Coffee product I owned. Every time you pull the carafe out it drips coffee onto the heating element. It's a relatively minor thing I suppose, but annoying for someone who really like to keep things clean..."
Linda Birkley,1.0,"December 12, 2015",Purchased this Aug 5 2015. Inexpensive. Thought it would be decent. It was....for about 4 months. Went to use it today Dec 12. The lights come on but it won't brew. They just don't make stuff like they used to.
Jane Hess,5.0,"May 25, 2013","This is a great coffee maker for the price. It is fast, efficient, and chimes when coffee is ready. It also shuts itself off after about 2 hours.

This item was delivered to my home 6/12/13 and here it is, slightly less than 6 months later and it is as dead as a doornail!  the strong brew feature never worked!  Trust me, keep looking..this is not the coffee maker for you!"
Max,2.0,"November 16, 2011","Well.. first, I suppose you get what you pay for, but largely influenced by the Consumer-Reports choice of this coffee maker as one of the products of 2011, I went ahead and purchased this mess of a coffee maker. We used to own the Cuisinart DCC-1200, which I absolutely love, but it broke down. So it was time to purchase a replacement and I went for, what I thought, would be the best bang for the buck. I was wrong, so wrong. I should have went ahead and got myself the same coffee maker that I had (which you can get today at around $65!!).The good:1. It's priced very well.2. The coffee tastes acceptable.The bad:1. It's ugly. The shiny ""chrome"" front plate looks very much like children's stick on mirrors.2. It comes without a permanent filter, which adds cost and definitely prohibits you from making coffee right away.3. The water filter has to be placed onto the coffee filter before each cycle, and it easily falls onto the coffee while the machine is cooking.4. The switch to make the coffee ""strong"" is ridiculous, as you get stronger coffee by buying a different roast, not by cranking up the heat or letting the water run slower... that in turn only makes the coffee bitter.5. Overall, the coffee maker is very ""flimsy"".6. It's rather loud for a perfectly new and clean machine.So.. I guess at the end I should blame myself for being cheap and listening to Consumer Reports.."

hp,4.0,"October 29, 2013","overall it makes good coffee.  They should have some instructions on where to put the water filter--other than trial and error.  They also have no instructions, such as why you can't seem to choose the ""strong coffee"" unless you have the thermal pot. and it is  difficult to pour full pot without spilling down the sides."

JUAN JOSE GONZALEZ ESPANA,3.0,"January 10, 2017","This coffee maker worked for fine for a year and half. After that, it died. The lights on the screen are turn on but the boiling part is not working at all. It is not useful anymore. Before that it worked fine."
Amanda,1.0,"December 31, 2015","I only gave this coffee pot 1 star because it made me I would have not given it any stars other wise. I bought it on October 22, 2015 and it stopped working on December 31, 2015. I'm not very happy."
carolyn ungerecht,1.0,"August 21, 2016",The coffee maker works great but no for long. I had to replace the first one within the first 30 days and now the replacement doesn't work. All the display lights come on but won't function! Really frustrating!!! I need my coffee!
Deb,5.0,"January 19, 2015",a perfect gift for my sister.  She loves it.
Corey Vaughn,2.0,"July 19, 2016","The only reason I did not give it only one star is because for the time it worked, it was easy to use and made good coffee.  But after 5 months it WILL just randomly stop working."
Kevin I Duan,5.0,"November 18, 2013","Does the job and brew coffee well. The best thing is that you can buy replaceable carafes, since with my last machine we broke the glass carafe and couldn't find a replacement. Timer feature and everything else work well."
suzanne,1.0,"January 23, 2014",This makes the worse coffee I have ever tasted.  Went back to making single cups which is delicious.  Live in California and love Peets Coffee.  I cannot make it strong enough in this coffeemaker. Tried it for about 3 weeks.  Horrible

John M. Ebersole,5.0,"September 21, 2017",bought this 3 years ago.Still going strong!
Karl Nickl,4.0,"February 24, 2016","Been using this maker for months now. I like it a lot, and it's easy to use, but a few things bug me. Always use the ""strong"" setting. The normal setting is far too weak, and results in a cup that tastes bland, and more like flavored water than a full bodied cup of coffee. It would be nice if there was more granular control over this. Additionally, the machine will beep to indicate the pot is done about a couple minutes prematurely. These are minor annoyances however, for a machine that makes an alltogether great cup of coffee."
Ann Montgomery,5.0,"July 10, 2013","Super conveniences that these coffee pots have... brew strength button, simple to use, and makes coffee quickly and consistently. The red one is a cheerful addition to my kitchen at home.  Liked it so much that we got a black one for our lake house, too!"

Douglas A. Fleet,4.0,"November 8, 2013",I had returned another model of Mr Coffee to Walmart because it leaked on first two tries-one cleaning mode and second regular pot! ALL OVER COUNTER AND FLOOR!

BrookTrout,1.0,"March 11, 2016","This coffee maker looks great on our counter top.  It is stylish and sleek, also a lot quieter than our previous one.  Very happy with it.  REVISED:  I dislike this coffee maker.  It makes a horribly weak cup of coffee.  I at first thought it was the filter on top of the grounds, but I removed that and it still makes a very weak cup of coffee.  I tried the ""strong cup"" button with no luck.  After brewing a pot you open the top and most of the coffee grounds are completely dry.  I am hoping I can return this."

Ollie A,5.0,"February 18, 2014",Nice machine with cool styling. Makes a pot in about 10 minutes. Has a brew strength setting. Hot plate works really good. The coffee taste way better than what came from our old pot.

gmajan,3.0,"February 25, 2014","Makes great coffee . . . but only keeps hot for 2 hours after brewing and no way to activate the ""hot plate"" after that.  Since I a the only one who drinks coffee on a regular basis by the time I am ready for another cup it has already turned cold."

deemac,1.0,"September 27, 2015","Great while it lasted.Bought this coffee maker in April 2015 and was pleased with the price and the coffee it made,however,the maker has just died September 2015.I cannot recommend this maker ."
CT,4.0,"September 23, 2015",When it arrived I didn't rinse it as instructed. My 1st cup of coffee tasted like melted plastic. Undrinkable. I then ran a whole full cycle of water through it as if making coffee. Problem solved. Plastic smell went away. This machine does what it is supposed to do. My only gripe is that the class container is very thin and will break very easy. Very cheap. I would recommend this overall! Price vs value it works!
Amazon Customer,1.0,"October 19, 2016","Plastic reservoir emits a strong chemical odor, which is imparted to the coffee. Tried to get rid odor several ways; (vinegar, etc.) Impossible to make a palatable coffee. I finally threw the machine in the dumpster.Brad"
Annemieke Jordan,5.0,"April 2, 2016","Why did I not buy this sooner? What a treat to wake up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee! For years I used a standard coffee maker and of course it did the job (also a Mr. Coffee). For only a little bit more money, you have the option to pre-set your desired brewing time and it's wonderful. I am highly satisfied and recommend this to anyone looking for a good coffee machine without spending a fortune. Well done Mr. Coffee!"
Brenda Bromfield,4.0,"November 25, 2014",it gets the job done
Omar Alnajjar,5.0,"September 27, 2015","This coffee maker makes coffee better than StarBucks'. Coffee really tastes amazing.

ryan ledra,5.0,"January 20, 2013",Good product and fast hipping. I bought it a a gift and they loved it. I would recommend this item
KerryM,4.0,"October 28, 2013",I really like this coffee pot.  My only recommendation is to get the thermal pot to keep the coffee hot for longer than the 2 hour auto shutoff and preserve the fresh taste of the coffee.

B. D. McCarthy,5.0,"June 25, 2013","I've owned them all, and have already come to the realization that they're disposable.  After a year, I don't care what you do, if there is fresh water in the reservoir 50% of the time it's going to stagnate, there are going to be grounds caught in the line ect... For $34 dollars you can't go wrong, it makes a great cup of coffee."
buffsabre,1.0,"January 24, 2015",I never realized I could make coffee at home that was as smoky as a Scotch whisky from Islay. If you like coffee that tastes smoky and smells of plastic I would recommend this.Tried cleaning several times and the smoke flavor did not dissipate. Ended up returning.
Golden,5.0,"August 26, 2013",It works well and takes about a minute per cup to brew.  My only complaint is the digital clock face is dark and it is difficult to see the time.

Amazon Customer,1.0,"August 27, 2016","The machine does not work. It heats up, makes lots of noise, but won't make coffee. It arrived in the coffee maker box with no shipping box. That was odd, but not a problem. The problem is that it doesn't work."

Geoff Valentine,1.0,"October 22, 2014","My decision to buy was based on the Consumer Reports recommendation. Despite my running plain water through many, many times, this coffeemaker imparts a terrible off flavor/aroma to coffee that renders it undrinkable. I'm very disappointed."

Sonali,4.0,"August 23, 2014",Good value for the money. The coffeemaker works well and brews a nice cup of coffee. If you are buying this product make sure you are aware that the carafe is made of glass and that the product does not come with a permanent coffee filter.

J. Lopez,3.0,"February 8, 2015",it's a good coffee maker but you can't adjust the time it stays on.  After 2 hours is off and conflicts our family timing
Braden Weinstock,5.0,"March 4, 2014","This coffee maker is not super fancy but it does just what you need it to do for a fair price. It has a timer, brews at different strengths, and it nice looking all for a good price."

david covert,5.0,"September 20, 2015",Perfect
tannercat81,5.0,"April 2, 2014",This is the coolest looking coffee maker.  I was very impressed with its sleek look.  Not complicated to operate.  Highly recommend.
Les Wolf,3.0,"July 20, 2014","New and improved design is awkward to fill with both coffee & water. The clock display is no longer backlit, rendering it useless except as a timer. The water level indicator is inconvenient to see as well. Generally speaking; not so 'improved' in my opinion."
Douglas B.,1.0,"September 29, 2015","Used it about six times, then it stopped working correctly, and had to clean up a the over-flow of coffee that was all over the counter.  Brand new coffee maker is now garbage."
BB,1.0,"May 9, 2016",Heating element died after only 9 months of use.  Only repairable if you are an electronics hobbyist.  Apparently the relays in these things are notorious for failing.  Lame.
MC Mom,5.0,"January 12, 2013","It does what it is supposed to.......makes good coffee.  It is easy to operate and the glass pot doesn't dribble everywhere.  Finally, someone figured out how to make a pot that is user friendly."
Kindle Customer,5.0,"March 11, 2013",We ordered this based on the rating by Consumer Reports. So far it has not disappointed. Good coffeemaker with a great price.
Davidius,5.0,"December 10, 2011","We have gone through several coffee makers over the past few years and so far are very pleased with this Mr. Coffee.  It's easy to use, assuming that you're willing to read a few simple directions and gives you the options you need to make a cup of coffee to suit your taste.  We've only had it for a little over a month, but so far, so good."
Madeline,1.0,"July 20, 2014","We noticed a terrible plastic smell which prohibited from us using the product for a while. We cleaned it several times and ran it numerous times without any success. We searched online and tried different methods to get rid of that smell, but it won't just go away even after several week."
JvS,1.0,"January 18, 2012","Indeed, as pointed out by several reviewers, this item ("
mrcatphish,4.0,"December 26, 2015","Well it's a coffee pot and there really isn't a lot to say usually about them.  I can say that I have been married for 16 years and after our first coffee pot that lasted for about 5 years, we have had nothing but trouble with coffee pots.  A year or two in they die out.  Those and toasters.  You know they never die at an optimum time either.We have had this Mr. Coffee now for 3 or 4 years and it has been great for us.  Brews a good pot of coffee and no issues (crosses fingers hoping he didn't just jinx himself!)I'd buy another one if this died"
mk,4.0,"June 23, 2013","Easy to use, and the the strength brew setting, you can adjust to taste.  The only improvement would to illuminate the clock, since it is very hard to see."
snoopyfan,5.0,"November 7, 2012",This coffeemaker is top rated in consumer reports. Keeps the coffee hot unlike our last one that was just warm. Really like this.
Betty Liptak,4.0,"September 28, 2015",The coffee is kept very warm which is a good thing. But I noticed there is no light for the clock. I cannot see anywhere in the literature if there is a light for the clock. It is very hard to tell the time. Otherwise we like it very much.
Linda Julius,5.0,"November 10, 2014",was a great gift to give
Jeffco,4.0,"May 12, 2013","Brews fast & easy to use.I wish the alarm for brewing and turn-off were a little louder. It can be difficult to hear, otherwise no complaints."
Jillian,5.0,"February 18, 2016","I am absolutely thrilled with this coffee maker.  The amount of features for the price are ideal.  I have been using this pot for about 3 months now and it is working like a champ.I originally purchased it because I wanted a coffee pot with a timer and this one never fails me.  The quality is great, it is not cheaply made.  If you are thinking about buying it, just make the leap and do it."
John Brydle,4.0,"August 22, 2014",Works well
DONNA,2.0,"November 25, 2016",Purchased this coffee maker in July 2015.  Loved it until today 11/25/16!!  No coffee this morning for me or my 5 house guests!!!  Aaaarrrrgggg....Will not be purchasing a Mister Coffee product again!!
Rick Adams,5.0,"March 25, 2015",Works great
Jennifer B.,1.0,"September 18, 2013",I purchased this on Amazon because consumer report said it was the best but the first one came I cleaned it with vinegar and the steel was damaged from the steam before even brewing coffee! Then a powdery green substance leaked from the controls. I contacted mr coffee and they a replacement that did the same thing! Mr coffee then sent me a different model which seems to be working well. DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER< it's garbage!
Sharolynn,5.0,"January 1, 2015",I love my new Mr Coffee. I had looked around my local stores and could not find any that were programmable. I also wasn't interested in the K cups. I wanted something easy to use but not too fancy. This is what I now have. My husband likes it too.
Bryan D. Hinton,3.0,"August 19, 2016","Worked great for 15 months of daily use, approximately 900 cups of coffee, then broke (won't heat up). That averages to about 4 cents a cup. I'm disappointed it didn't last longer, but then again it is inexpensive."
andres,5.0,"November 5, 2014",My mom loves this it was a gift for her birthday and she its loving it a lot
Norma Peterson,4.0,"July 1, 2015","It's good, but I miss the earlier edition!"
jh39,4.0,"March 15, 2015",Works fine.  I bought the extra 8-cup carafe.  This carafe is not as well insulated as the vacuum carafe I have used before.
William Amerman,3.0,"June 27, 2013","I've gotten the smell down by leaving the top open after coffee is made.  Drying it out helps a lot.  It also leaks a bit between the coffee pot and the spring-mounted plastic doo-dad at the top.  On the plus side the coffee is hot and if the maker has dried out before making a new pot, it makes really good coffee."
Janelle Naylon,5.0,"July 9, 2012",Went to Consumer Reports and they listed this coffee maker as their top pick over many other higher priced machines. Having used it for almost a month we are very pleased and it is brewing a better cup of coffee than our previous Cuisinart that cost three times as much. I highly recommend this Mr. Coffee machine.

Kindle Customer,1.0,"February 21, 2015","It started out great, but now is just a pathetic malfunctioning disappointment.  It has developed two major issues:1) It will not brew a full pot of coffee.  We got the Stainless Steel coffee pot and for some reason it will only brew half of the pot.  It doesn't seem to matter how much water (too little, too much or just right) is in the reserve.2) The coffee is at best mildly warm.I just tried to return the Coffee maker to Amazon  and find that I missed the deadline by 2 weeks."
A. M. DEWITT,5.0,"July 4, 2014",Works very well and makes great coffee. Meets all of our expectations.
Linford&Anna,5.0,"November 21, 2016",Works great! Thot it was starting to have issues but after I ran vinegar thru for one cycle to clean it it works great again
John A. Scott,5.0,"September 6, 2014",Excellent!  Fast brew and every bit as good a cup of coffee as the much more expensive coffee maker it replaced.  Highly recommend!

Forestcoast Books,2.0,"May 28, 2015",Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT was received 2-4-2015 and worked great. Then on 5-29-2015 it just stopped working! Neither with a bang nor a whimper. It just will no longer turn on. No coffee just when it was most needed! Decided to try a different model going forward.
julie mcbride,4.0,"March 15, 2013","makes great coffee. very attractive. good thing that you can program to have the coffee brew before you wake up in the morning because, it's not lighting fast. should have known that it was going to have some speed issues when it took its sweet time getting here. about 7 days longer then first told."
Thomas Testa,5.0,"March 11, 2014",This makes a great cup of coffee and tea. I would definitely buy this coffee pot again. I also used the delay start function and it worked wonderfully.

Midtown Bubba,5.0,"January 2, 2012",Saw this coffee maker was rated a Best Buy by Consumer Reports.  Researched and found the best price (and free delivery) on Amazon.com  Easy to use and makes a great cup of coffee.
Randy G Herrera,1.0,"February 2, 2012","Consumer Reports loved this coffeemaker...it was only $30 so I figured, ""What do I have to lose?""  Well, yes, it makes coffee very quickly....but I had to use twice as much coffee to get the same strength of coffee from my old Philips coffeemaker.  Yes, twice as much coffee....AND, this is using the ""strong"" setting on the maker.Maybe because it's a flat filter and I've been using a cone filter...don't know.  But, spare yourself.  Don't buy this...unless you own shares of a coffee company..."
Sasha,4.0,"September 21, 2014","I absolutely love this coffee maker!! The delay function, the look, I love it. Negative, my coffee tastes a bit like plastic. It's not too bad though, and after a few brews it goes away."
Laura J. Friedman,1.0,"July 25, 2014","It developed a strong musty/moldy smell after just a few months of being used.  I've tried cleaning it with vinegar, always leaving it open to air dry and nothing helps."
Henry,2.0,"March 5, 2014","I bought this item based on the recommendation from Consumer Report.  However, the first thing I noticed is the strong plastic smell when I open the lid to fill water.  I followed the instruction to go through one cycle with clear water only.  Then I made coffee twice.  I still smell the plastic.  I then went through clear water one more time.  The water tasted horrible. So I returned it."
Silvio F.,3.0,"June 13, 2016",It didn't come with a scoop...
Summer 1,1.0,"January 2, 2016",Didn't want to believe the other reviews but it does taste and smell like plastic would not recommend it
Derek,4.0,"September 10, 2014","This coffee maker has done exactly what it should do, make a good cup of coffee. I am extremely pleased with the programmability of it, the only qualm I have is that the filter is a little tough to place at first. But other than that, great machine!"

Rabbit,4.0,"October 2, 2014",Makes wonderful coffee.
Sylvia,5.0,"November 28, 2014","It is very convenient and quick to make coffee at morning when I rush to my school. It only takes like 5 minutes to finish. However, it will keep coffee warm for only around 3 hours. And it is somewhat difficult to clean it up."
Matthew J.,5.0,"July 11, 2013","I've only had this Coffee Making for 4 days but I absolutely love it.  It makes great coffee and has lots of features for an inexpensive coffee maker.If you're looking for an easy to use, nice looking and inexpensive coffee making this is for you."

B Wade,1.0,"May 28, 2016","Bought it October and the heating element stopped working in May.  During the time the coffee maker was working, we had to microwave our coffee to get it to an appealing temperature before drinking it."

Suzette Vernon,5.0,"December 31, 2012",My husband likes his coffee HOT.  Consumer Report (CR) rated this coffeemaker as # 1 for this feature.Bought it for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES it.

Sara Mendez,5.0,"March 21, 2016","I'm kind of a coffee snob, from a family of coffee snobs. Life is too short for bad coffee. I love this machine! It makes great coffee, is very easy to program and use. I love the feature that allows you to see how long the coffee has been sitting since being brewed. I'm extremely happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend this coffee machine!"
LeGrand Glen LeBaron,1.0,"April 17, 2015","Deserves negative 5 stars. We removed and washed the coffee holder & carafe, ran water through the coffeemaker about 10-15 times & no matter what we did, our coffee smelled and tasted like plastic. Not satisfied with product."

James Johnson,5.0,"December 7, 2014","Easy to use, coffee tastes good and the coffee pot is a newer design and pours much better then my old one,no spills with the first cup. So after one month I'm happy. Probably won't last 10 years like my last one thou."
Amazon Customer,5.0,"November 3, 2015","It's the best coffeemaker, eva! I've had an Amazon gift certificate for two years, but felt guilty buying books on the site--so instead I bought a coffeemaker, upgraded to the thermal pot (which keeps it from tasting burnt), and bought the basket style gold tone permanent filter. It is one of the best decisions, actually series of decisions, that I've ever made. I swell with pride every morning at 5:15 as I walk from my bedroom to the kitchen knowing there is perfectly brewed coffee waiting for me. Sometimes throughout the week I'll feel a tinge of self-doubt, but then I'll think, Hey, me, stop doubting yourself you're the guy who bought the best coffeemaker, ever! And then I'm like, yeah, me, you're right that was pretty awesome. If I can pull off some stuff like that, what else am I capable of? Everything, that's what! Five stars to me, and the Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker in Chrome!"

Ron Hill,5.0,"February 18, 2014","My morning coffee had become very bitter of late.  After some research, I stumbled on a review of this machine.  Ran it through the recommended initial cleaning last night and then brewed first pot this morning.  There is the taste I have been missing!"
Matthew,5.0,"January 9, 2013",I got this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She uses it everyday and says the coffee tastes very great. I suggest the gold perma filter as well.
ROBERT ALBERT,5.0,"March 9, 2014",GREAT ITEM Not always easy to satisfy 30 seniors but this MR COFFEE did just that.  No one complains that the coffee is not hot  enough.  I do not have to worry that  the pot was turned off when the last senior leaves the club because it will turn off by itself.
Marian Y. Payne,5.0,"November 16, 2015",Great coffee pot!
Gary,4.0,"February 24, 2013",I bought this as part of a Christmas gift for someone. They and the people who had coffee from it liked it and thought the coffee was good. One complaint I heard was that it isn't actually part stainless steel but plastic. Aside from that. No other complaints as of yet.
Brian,5.0,"November 17, 2015",Easy to use and works great.
Jordan C.,5.0,"July 15, 2015","Literally couldn't live without it.... coffee is life and this thing will have a pot ready for you when wake up.  Plus no dealing with stupid k-cups or having to make coffee 12 times a day.  I brew a whole pot and just take the pot with me in the vehicle when I leave for work.  Sure it's hard to drink the coffee straight out of the pot, but life is a tough game."
Unknown,5.0,"May 1, 2014",I just love my Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-cup coffee maker. It slides in and out of the corner very easy. When the coffee is done it beeps and then will beep again when it is going to shut off. Like I said I love it.
Crystal S,5.0,"August 29, 2013",This is perfect for the office. I can set the timer and it is ready when I get there in the mornings. No complaints about it at all.
Jiraf27,5.0,"July 6, 2015","I've had this coffee pot now a little over 2 years, and for the price point, you can't go wrong. Makes great coffee every time, easy to use, and all the features you'd expect from a modern day coffee maker.  It brews at a very hot temperature which is good for flavor but not for your tongue. Drop a single ice cube in your cup to bring the temp down a few degrees and you are all set."

J. Capps,1.0,"January 4, 2015",The coffeemaker stopped working after 3 months. Water would no longer pump through the unit. Tried cleaning it out with vinegar but it didn't help. Seems to be a low quality unit. Definitely would not buy again.
Roger Gossett,3.0,"October 11, 2013","The function, materials and appearance of this product are first rate.  The problem is that it makes a very ordinary cup of coffee. We have a senior citizen coffee maker that is on it's last leg but makes an excellent cup of coffee.  Too bad it is no longer in production."
JoeB,3.0,"November 8, 2013","It does make good coffee, the price was good, and it looks good. However, as in other reviews, you cannot totally fill the coffeemaker with the pot, the many opening at the top creates alot of steam and noise.."
Cassandra Karpisek,5.0,"November 27, 2013",Easy to use. It has coffee made in less then 5 minutes which my bf just totally loves. I would recommend this coffee maker to everyone.
mpwinter,3.0,"July 6, 2013","I honestly can't rate the functionality of the coffeemaker because I was so disappointed in the looks.  I realize that the coffeemaker is inexpensive but I guess I didn't expect it to look ""cheap"".  The silver is some kind of plastic and was so off-putting that I had to send it back."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"April 19, 2016",Purchased in March and no longer working in April - conveniently 2 days outside my return window.
Bruce D. Kilgore,2.0,"June 5, 2015","The filter is poor quality and poor design.  Therefore, the coffee maker does not make good coffee.  The water drips into the grounds at only one spot and, thus, drills a hole through the grounds.  The result is weak and inconsistent coffee."
Jennifer Nevois,1.0,"December 6, 2015",Stopped working after less than six months. Bummer. Won't brew at all.

Charles Low,4.0,"January 29, 2014","The main thing is that my wife likes it.  I also like it very much, the coffee is hot and taste good.  there is not too much else you could say about a coffee pot, other than it looks good.  thanks"
Lyman Rate,5.0,"July 12, 2015","Best coffee maker I've had, and I've had a lot. For the price this one is worth it's weight. From style that works in my kitchen and practical use, I can't say enough good things about it. I needed to replace the one in my kitchen and so when I did, I wanted to find something that would work, but not break the bank. This did it and I couldn't be happier."
Kindle Customer,5.0,"March 27, 2016","If it was socially acceptable to marry this coffee pot then I would... It just gets me, knows I need that cup of coffee ready at exactly 5:15 am on my way out the door to an early day at work! It also knows I am a complex person...Sometimes I want it super strong in brew strength but other days I want the mellow more medium strength.Perfection on the countertop!"
Joseph Lorkowski,5.0,"December 29, 2014","Great coffee maker, great seller. No problems or hassles"
sjt,1.0,"May 20, 2012","We had high hopes for this coffeemaker given its stellar ratings in Consumer Reports, but it disappointed from the very start. The coffee it delivered was not as hot as we would like it, and the taste was always bland. We use very good beans, ground just before making coffee and they have otherwise always delivered a very good cup of coffee. Not with this machine, unfortunately. We had also purchased a thermal carafe with it and liked the Mr. Coffee's ability to detect whether a glass or metal carafe was being used and make adjustments accordingly. But, alas, the results were the same no matter how we brewed and we ended up returning the items to Amazon.I think buyers can do better and indeed, this may be one item you may want to test drive yourself based on what friends may have in their kitchens or workrooms to save the hassle. Everyone's tastes are different, so you may be very happy with this unit; we were not."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"October 29, 2015","We ordered 2 for our office. From day one, with both units, we had issues with coffee overflowing basket & lots of grains getting in finished pot - no matter what filter or coffee we used!"

George R.,5.0,"February 4, 2016",Bought this to replace an old tired Mr. Coffee that earned its retirement. This one so far is superior to the one it replaced which seems to be an older model of this one. I love the water filtration system. I live in the city and it takes the chlorine taste out. The coffee perks quickly and at the right temperature. It just makes a very good hot cup of coffee.
Amazon Customer,5.0,"October 2, 2016",It's great! My girlfriend and I work alot and this keeps the coffee flowing. We use it everyday more than once! Would recommend this for everyday use.

Edward G Short,5.0,"June 11, 2013",Great coffeemaker for the price. Very pleased! Has any option needed and makes great coffee fast. Beeps to let you know it is ready and cutting off auto. so you know if you want to push the button to keep it hot. It also lets you adjust the brew etc. works great. No issues at all.
jhack,1.0,"March 17, 2016",Stop working  after 3 months
Aaron,1.0,"August 13, 2016","Heating element stopped working after 6 months of daily use, very disappointing seeing as my last Mr. Coffee, which was a similar model, lasted 6+ years"
RTregaskis,5.0,"December 10, 2016",Works very well!
Kasey Thibodaux Gould,1.0,"April 14, 2017",Don't buy this. It just quit brewing after less than a year.
Wendy Dennis,5.0,"January 11, 2012","This is an excellent coffee maker.  Never mind that it makes a good cup of coffee, especially when the strong brew option is selected, the carafe does no drip when pouring, a HUGE plus! It is about time someone designed a carafe that doesn't drip all over the place. The unit is easy to keep clean, as well."
sandy,1.0,"December 30, 2015","Horrible - I highly recommend against this.  There is a flaw in the design, which results in coffee all over your counter!  The repository that holds the coffee filter and percolates the coffee has a small valve at the bottom which allows the coffee to drip through to the carafe which sticks constantly and causes the coffee filter to overflow causing grounds and coffee to fill the interior of the brewer and overflow all over the place.  Its absolutely awful!  I've tried various paper filters, wire basket filters no help.  I've also tried modifying the hole/valve at the bottom which regulates the pass through of the coffee ... finally threw it away, a waste of money!!!"
HDT,2.0,"August 6, 2015",Only lasted 13 months.
PmWong,1.0,"December 24, 2015",Heating element died around 5 months of use. Low quality parts or poor quality control for this unit.

Susan,2.0,"February 27, 2015",Bad product.  Doesn't process all of the water so you don't get a full or good cup of coffee.
Mike,3.0,"February 19, 2015","EDIT - OK, so I contacted the company and they are sending me another one free of charge, I don't have to send back the original.  Hopefully this one lasts a long time...  ORIG - Crapped out after only a couple months, buy something else!"

JesseJunghyeon,3.0,"May 24, 2011","wWhen I opened this coffee maker up a plastic smell hit me in the face like a frying pan. So I did what everyone eles would think of, I ran viniger water through it twice. After that the smell was still there so I ran lemon juice and water through it twice as well. That didnt seem to work so I made a full pot of coffee, then ran that through the maker. Also I ran just water through it until it came out clean and now the smell is gone and it just smells like coffee. I gave it three stars because you shouldnt have to do that to a coffee maker."
Joanne Schrems,5.0,"February 18, 2013","It's great, my only comment is that condensation build up inside where the filter is and it runs down when you open it after the coffee is gone and you go to clean it but the coffee is defintley hotter than any maker I have had. It also is very nice looking.I am glad I bought it."
Nancy M. Polen,5.0,"May 27, 2014","So far love it. Easy to use and good coffee, but have only had for short time and have not tried the Water filtration system, want to get the Mr. Coffee permanent filter to try it."

The second one quit working today, June 2016.  Each one operated only 7 months which makes this a very expensive coffee maker.  Will not purchase again!  Looking for another brand."

Agykoo,5.0,"April 14, 2016","Have had this maker for a few months now. Still as amazing as when we got it. Bold setting really stands out as it really works well (sadly few do). We use the permanent filter and water filters both of witch we like a lot too. Easy to use. 5 stars for sure.Only minor complaint is we wish it had longer then 2 hour keep warm, as well as an option to keep warm again after the first 2 hours."
Carl Nechtman,2.0,"March 17, 2014","Like other reviewers noted, the coffee can have an odd, plasticky taste when left in their too long. This is greatly improved with the included water filter"

janice michael,5.0,"December 23, 2012","I love my coffee maker.  It keeps the coffee hot for two hours, before it shuts off automatically, which I also like.  It's designed for ease of use and doesn't disappoint.  the black-and-silver is very rich-looking."
david r.,3.0,"April 6, 2015","It's good but it doesn't seem to get super hot.  My first one, so perhaps this is the way they all are."
Caitlin,4.0,"February 17, 2016","This coffee maker makes an excellent cup of coffee. My only gripe is that you have to use the circle disk coal filter. If you attempt to make a quick cup of coffee without placing this filter, in between the coffee grains and the water spout, only half of the coffee grains get soaked with hot water. This forces you to use the filter everytime."
Johnny East,4.0,"March 4, 2015",It simply works

Kindle Customer,4.0,"March 4, 2011","We are heavy coffee drinkers and have gone through a number of expensive coffee makers in the last year.  This machine is excellent so far!

So plan on getting about 40 uses out of it before it just completely stops working. Of course I have had it too long to return. I'm so bummed. First negative review I am leaving on Amazon.

Audrey Goldman,5.0,"January 3, 2013",I looked in Consumber Report for the type of coffee maker I wanted and this was rated their best buy. I did not want a single use product but rather a coffee pot to make enough for guests. This is easy to use and the coffee is delicious.

Kyle E.,5.0,"January 12, 2013","I've have this machine for a few months now and it hasn't yet crapped out on me, like most inexpensive coffee makers. Great quality, for a great price. The permanent basket is also definitely worth investing in! I'm never buying a coffee filter again."

John from Peoria,1.0,"January 11, 2015","The filter basket sometimes gets clogged during the brewing cycle, preventing the brewed coffee from trickling into the carafe -- instead the brewed coffee overflows onto the counter, making a big mess.  Removing the spring from the stopper on the bottom of the filter basket improves the problem somewhat, but nothing short of removing the stopper completely fixes the issue, which means that you have to wait until the brewing is completed and all the coffee is done dripping through the grounds (or completely remove the filter basket) before you can remove the carafe and pour your coffee."
YB,1.0,"January 26, 2014","after 3 months, the dripping current becomes so heavy that it blow the coffee ground away! Now the ""dripping"" from the machine is like my kitchen water tab"
Julie Massey,5.0,"March 22, 2015","We absolutely love this coffee maker! My coffee has never been so hot! And the taste is out of this world!  The only thing we don't like is, the clock on it does not have a light. So you can't see the time very well."
Deborah Caldwell,5.0,"March 12, 2014",Water temp is higher than most and extracts the most flavor!  Good looking addition to countertop. Water tank is placed in an inconvenient angle.

George R.,5.0,"September 3, 2012","The  Item was what I was expecting and delivery was prompt.It brews a good cup of coffee and came with easily understood instructions. I saw the same Item elsewhere with a larger pricetag,but saw no reason to pay more. My overall experience was A-One."
Phillip E Smith,5.0,"February 22, 2016",Works Great. Makes great coffee and looks good too. I like the new addition of the in basket filter to help filter out anything in the water. I really like how the carafe doesn't spill all over the place when pouring the coffee as some other brands do. Also the looks of the Coffee Maker is a nice addition to the Kitchen Counter.
John J DeCoopman,4.0,"December 27, 2012",I had an old Mr. Coffee for years... no bells whistles... it finally died... this one has way cool features and makes a great cup of coffee... nuff said

Rachel Brede,5.0,"May 29, 2014",I am very happy with this coffeemaker. Its size is perfect for my small kitchen.  It keeps coffee hot for 2 hours. The delay brew is easy to program and set. And it looks good.
Stef,5.0,"January 17, 2013",The coffee maker isn't as quick as our Bunn but has a better quality of coffee with using less coffee. We like it very much
Harriet A. Montgomery,5.0,"November 7, 2014",Always makes a good cup of coffee.  The automatic shut off feature is a plus.
Sue Davis,1.0,"October 10, 2016",I purchased this coffee pot in June and it quit working completely in September. Now its too late to return.
Cataholic,2.0,"May 6, 2015","In order to make good tasting coffee similar to coffee houses, the water must reach a certain temperature when it hits the grounds. It worked great for a month and then the water would not heat up as hot leaving the coffee tasting bad. I went back to my peculator.  Don't waste your money!"
Little_Red_77,3.0,"November 15, 2015",Worked great for three months then died on me.

Teresa Davis,5.0,"June 8, 2013",This is a very good coffee maker. The caraf does not drip when you pour the coffee. I have not seen any other coffee maker that does not drip.I would buy this again makes a full 12 cups.
Karen Walker,1.0,"November 17, 2015",i used it once then it never worked again  :( I did not have the box so no way to return.
J. Jolly,3.0,"November 21, 2015",I would rate it only fair. It brews coffee that's fit to drink but that's about all. Looks cheap. When we received it we cleaned it thoroughly in a vinegar solution to remove a bad odor that some complain about and never smelled anything bad.  For the price it's very good. But a great coffee maker will cost 3 or 4 times as much. Your choice.
Nature Lover,5.0,"July 4, 2015",I bought this because we had company coming; and one of our guests gets up really early in the morning and I wanted him to have his coffee already brewed.  It worked fine.  It does what it says and brews good coffee.  I also like the blue & green brew lights.  They look good; as does the coffee maker sitting on the counter.
Susan Lorenzen,5.0,"August 31, 2015",I love this machine !  It works better than my previous 'expensive' machine.  It makes a wonderful cup of coffee and it looks good too !

Donald Cameron,5.0,"January 4, 2014",The coffee maker is very easy to use and keeps the coffee nice and hot. The last mr. coffee we bought had a thermal pot and was not at all as good as this model. We like it so much we bought the same model for our daughter.
frgholo,4.0,"June 10, 2013",I think the coffee maker works as expected.  The clock face does not light up but since there are numerous clocks in the kitchen it is not a big deal only makes it a little hard to set the delay feature.
Rex Wilson,5.0,"February 9, 2015",I know I will love this coffee maker be good
dave york,5.0,"November 16, 2014",Very nice.
Sara (& Echo),5.0,"May 14, 2014","I have my Keurig, she wanted a coffee maker. We agreed on this. She can't be happier. It matches in our little coffee corner and it brews her Storyville and Stumptown how she likes, so that made me happy. GREAT PRICE for happiness without breaking the bank."
Nancy,1.0,"May 28, 2015",It starts leaking after 2 months of purchase.
Burnzy,1.0,"February 12, 2016",Bought this Mr.Coffee Maker August 2015.It stopped working today 2/12/2016.  No quality manufacturing items today.

Bernie Tapetillo,3.0,"December 3, 2015","I had a better machine than this before but it seems that they do not make it anymore, this has what I would call unflavorable coffee when it comes out, will have to try another clean out to see if it improves, other than that this is only a OK Coffee Maker"
Louise,4.0,"March 5, 2015",I have just used it a few times but it smells like burning plastic inside where the water goes.
Bev,5.0,"March 8, 2014","I love this coffeemaker!  It makes a perfect cup of coffee using either the glass or thermal carafe.  I'm thinking of buying another (just to have a ""spare""!!)."
Kay Barber,2.0,"January 3, 2012","Bought this to replace another Mr. Coffee Coffeemaker. The cord is over 6"" shorter than our previous one, so the coffeemaker won't work where we want to place it. Wish Amazon posted information on cord length under product information."
Kelly Friesema,1.0,"April 30, 2017",I have had it for less than 2 years and it completely stopped working.
kay k currin,4.0,"May 15, 2014","This worked nicely, had all features that I wanted. The filter that came with the pot made the coffee grounds spill out of the holder so I stopped using it. Otherwise, liked the pot."
coffe lover,3.0,"December 11, 2011","Makes good coffee which is the most important thing.  The top to the carafe has a flimsy hinge and I'm sure will break easily.  That will lead to another sale for Mr. Coffee for a replacement.  The water filter they incorporated into this model is a farce and totally unnecessary, just another money maker for them as you keep buying filters.  How bad does your water have to be need a cheap filter before it goes into your coffee?  There is a button for strength of brew that must be pushed each time you brew if you want strong coffee.  How many people change their minds on this?  Today I want strong coffee but tomorrow I want weaker coffee.  Why have this at all?  If I want weaker coffee I'll put in less grounds."
Purdue,1.0,"October 6, 2015",Unit lasted less than 90 days and it is not under warranty and cannot be replaced.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE PURCHASE THIS UNIT!

HS,2.0,"October 17, 2017",It worked great until it broke completely within two years of purchase.
Leslie Flemming,4.0,"March 16, 2015","Makes excellent coffee, but the melted plastic odour while it brews is off putting.  I understand it will diminish over time.  It doesn't seem to affect the coffee flavour."

Melinda Davey,5.0,"April 17, 2015",Simple easy to use. The delay timer is great. My favorite feature is that you can make different strengths. I need a strong cup and 5am and this does the job perfectly.
bob,1.0,"January 30, 2013","But the unit is difficult to fill with water, With an unlite clock one has to use a flashlight to see it and our kast one last just five weeks before the electronics failed."

island girl,3.0,"April 7, 2015",Oops!  The numbers are not readable on the clock - and it's not lighted.  The filter basket is poorly designed.  The water filter is like a bad joke.  It's a cheapie coffeemaker but it worked for me in a pinch.  Can't wait to get moved and buy a REAL coffeemaker again!
Kyle James,1.0,"August 11, 2015",Brewed one pot of coffee and now it wont turn on.

nassar,1.0,"January 12, 2017",I am very angry because of the lack of charging the same machine in which it requested that fraud in dealing
Jeffery J Moledor,2.0,"November 25, 2011","Despite a good review from Consumer Reports, I would only give this a fair.  Despite doing the recommended cleaning several times, there is still a plastic taste and smell to it.  Even going to better coffee and freshly grinding, the coffee taste is just okay and that may be giving it more credit than earned.  Keep looking, as I am sure there is something that does better coffee yet is still reasonably priced."
AL M.,5.0,"October 11, 2015","WORKS LIKE IT SHOULD, UNLIKE THE FIRST ONE I PURCHASED. IF THIS ONE DIES LIKE THE FIRST ONE DID, JUST AFTER A YEAR OF USE, I'LL BE CHANGING MY RATING AND PRODUCT."

kate,5.0,"October 22, 2011",I love the Mr. Coffee in black.  My white one always looked so dirty.  It was so hard to keep clean.  This one quickly brews a nice hot cup of coffee.  Good quality for the price.  I feel I can get comparable coffee to a coffee shop at home :)

Billy R. Jones,4.0,"April 18, 2014",Not a bad coffee maker.  About the only complaint is that it had kind of a 'plastic' smell the first few pots.  That seems to be going away after using it a few times though.Would recommend.
Darrell Brubaker,5.0,"October 27, 2013","I ordered this product based on price and most importantly because of their claim that the 'carafe does not drip', and after several weeks of daily use, I can attest that it doesn't."

Lisa,5.0,"June 5, 2015",It arrived early and was perfect. I can't wait to give it to my husband
Lashelle Greene,5.0,"May 8, 2016",perfect for the money spent. it does dribble a bit if you're not careful in pouring. the part that I like is that it beeps just before it shuts off to let you know that coffee won't be warm for long. It stays on long enough to devour the pot however without tasting like it's burnt. good product.
Lisa P.,1.0,"October 12, 2015",Horrible. Only had it for 2 months and it started leaking from the bottom. Bought a new one.

shasha0518,1.0,"January 7, 2016","Unpacked it, ran vinegar, a rinse of water, and was set for a fresh cup of coffee.  It was great, no smell or taste of plastic. As had been mentioned in other reviews. I did have the permanent basket from my other Mr. Coffee, which is essential to use with the charcoal filter. If not, it falls down.  And no overflow of grounds or water when using the charcoal filter, I also use a paper filter along with the permanent basket,  I do use a 5 stage RO filtered water in my machine, so I am hoping for 5 years out of my new Mr. Coffee, like I had with the last one (just a on/off Mr. Coffee machine, not this model). So far so good... I ground my beans Medium grind, BTW.  Will update if needed.. :)  Love it, it beeps when the coffee has finished brewing, and another set of beeps before the 2 hour auto shut off.  A big plus for me.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CFQJS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage  for permanent gold filterUPDATE: 7 months and the warming burner went out.

TAL,2.0,"February 29, 2016","after 10 months of 4/5 days/week of use, the machine stopped working.  Lights would turn on, but no brewing.  You get what you pay for with a cheap machine like this.  Covered under warranty so they are sending a replacement, but its unacceptable that a very simple appliance cant make it to even a year of use. Did make pretty good coffee while it lasted.  Didnt scorch, but was hot enough. Nice aesthetics to match our kitchen too."

Bo Peterburg,1.0,"October 21, 2013","Bought this unit because it got good reviews in Consumer Reports.  I don't know what they were thinking, because --- OMG --- this thing makes *terrible* coffee.  The unit has a disgusting plastic smell that is noticeable right out of the box, and this same smell is evident in the taste of the coffee.  I still can't get that nasty taste out of my mouth after drinking the coffee hours ago!  Yuck!I am not a coffee snob or anything, just a regular guy looking for a decent, affordable coffee maker.  I tried running a lot of cycles to see if the plastic taste/smell would go away, but I think it actually got *worse* with each cycle if that is possible.  My wife even noticed the smell in the house first thing when she walked in the door!I would strongly advise against purchasing this coffee maker."

terry leigh smith,3.0,"December 30, 2012","Coffeemaker was was OK.  To many unnecessay buttoms and clock does not have a light  and can barely see it even with bright lights on in kitchen.  Looks pretty, that is all."
Cathy Hale,2.0,"March 27, 2014",I ordered this for my bedroom so I can awake to fresh brewing coffee and have the clock so I can view the time at night when I get up at times.  The digital light on this coffee pot is black print on a grey background and is not lit up so you can't see it ever. Not at night and not even in the daylight. So now I only have a coffee pot and I still have no way to tell the time when I get up. ugh.
Regina Meauhead,5.0,"February 25, 2015","I love my new coffee pot, the smell of coffee wakes me up every morning."

David Messina,1.0,"September 11, 2013","I used this coffee make for 3 weeks and had a major intermittent problem. The coffee maker would get very hot and produce steam but very little strong coffee.

Eileen,1.0,"October 31, 2013","The coffee tastes weak even though I put double the amount that is suggested.  It beeps about 5 seconds after I turn it on and, even though I put it on strong brew, it takes about 1 minute to brew a 5 cup pot of weak coffee.This pot is replacing a Mr. Coffee that I had for 7 years that never failed to give a hot and full flavored cup of coffee.I would send it back, except I have already thrown the box away."

Amazon Customer,3.0,"March 8, 2016","Works great.  However, I have the worse time putting the coffee filter in and out every night, maybe its just me but its a pain none the less.  Also, there is a large amount of water that builds up on the bottom of the lid after each brew.  It worries my wife that with the humidity of where we are that over time it could mold.  It hasn't yet of course, but its just a concern."
Scott Devin,5.0,"December 20, 2012","My wife and I always check with our monthly Consumer Report, and this coffee make was rated excellent.  We checked every store in the valley here in the Phoenix area; could not find the exact BVMC-SJX33GT.  My wife is still having a problem trying to get the coffee maker to delay brew, and it  will not come on as directed.  She said she thinks it might not be working correctly, but will continue working with this model."

scott bradley,4.0,"April 18, 2016",I like the coffee pot itself but the lid opens to the left and i'm left handed and it is a little hard to pour water in.  Right handed i would miss the pot all together. Over-all nice coffee pot for the price.

Henry Franz,1.0,"September 7, 2017","coffee pot lasted a little over a year ad heating plate went out, made in China so what can you expect. Going to a camping fire percolator, tired of china made crap. NEW REVIEWS SHOW THIS IS BELOW STANDARDS AND WERE CHANGED TO SHOW THIS"

Alyssa Wagner,4.0,"August 22, 2015",This is a nice coffee maker however I feel it looks and feels cheaper than pictured. Almost like the stick on mirror stuff instead of actual stainless steel metal. That might just be though...

Gerry A,5.0,"January 27, 2016","OMG... this is one huge step of from my last Black and Decker machine. The coffee tastes so much better! Plus, the option to have an insulated carafe is a plus."
Clarissa,1.0,"November 24, 2013","If you do not have the basket in just right it floods over onto your counter. Technology did not help Mr. Coffee! I used to make my mother's coffee in a Mr. Coffee when I was a kid, no problem. This thing is ridiculous. My friends who have tried to make coffee at my house have flooded the kitchen too, so it is not just me!  Keep it simple and easy to use AND produce quality coffee."
Amazon Customer,5.0,"February 22, 2016","Very nice, this is my 3rd MR Coffee coffee maker, works perfect, seems like they have gone a little cheaper on the materials than the older ones, probably to keep the cost down, still a great value."
CR,1.0,"August 26, 2014",Well this coffee pot served us well for one year.  Then it died.  I would never buy another one again.  Spring for a more expensive brand that will actually work longer.

Kenneth P.,3.0,"November 11, 2015",fine
Melissa Lemons,1.0,"December 7, 2013",This is undoubtedly the worst coffee maker ever.  When you brew a pot of coffee it is COLD and you must wait at least 30 minutes for the heating plate to heat the coffee.  A total disappoint in a Mr. Coffee product.  I don't know where this coffee pot came from - but I doubt it came from Mr. Coffee itself.  I would not recommend anyone purchase it nor will I ever purchase a Mr. Coffee product again.
joanna donohue,1.0,"May 18, 2016",Didn't work when we plugged it in!!

Amazon Customer,1.0,"August 22, 2016",It stopped brewing after only 9 months of use.
Amazon Customer,1.0,"October 3, 2016",power is 110V
Amazon Customer,1.0,"December 31, 2015","I ordered this item on 12/26/15. When I make coffee, the inside basket where you put the coffee and filter does not stay down when making coffee, so the basket doesn't completely drain. It just makes a big mess. Please let me know how to get that basket replaced. The rest of the unit is intact, but if I have a mess every time I make coffee, it isn't going to work. Please let me know how I can get a replacement piece."
Jay G.,5.0,"December 27, 2015","Once you figure out how to use the delay feature is works great. Sometimes trying to make 2 cups of coffee it doesn't work so well, it makes it really watered down. Otherwise it works great."

Susan,4.0,"January 23, 2015","Clock is not illumined. I have not used this coffee maker yet so my rating is based only on the fact that the clock does not light up therefore it is completely useless for telling the time. You have to get within a couple inches to even see the time. The only usefulness of the clock is when setting the brew timer, which may be all one needs. It is disappointing that this lack of illumination is not stated up front."
D Welch,5.0,"February 15, 2016","Great product.  Timer works well, can strong and normal brew coffee, warm plate for two hours, and works with the carafe that I already had from previous product, good purchase for the money."
Petitesi020,5.0,"August 6, 2015","This works like a dream, easy to clean and set-up, and my morning coffee never tasted better. I like this better than my Keurig Vue!! Sometimes the simple coffee maker does the trick."
Marilyn & Kenny,5.0,"December 28, 2013",The regular/strong brewing strength features make this a really nice addition for our family as we all have different tastes!

J,3.0,"August 28, 2014",It's ok...but I sprang for a little more $ for the Hamilton Beach 46201 12 cup and that's a better machine.
Taryn,4.0,"May 3, 2016",Great coffee maker! I have used it every day for 7 months now and have not had any issues with it. The only problem is I haven't been able to figure out how to program it.
Norman Sassner,4.0,"December 13, 2013","very easy to use, easy to understand instructions  makes a good pot of coffee. Looks very good in my kitchen."
Roberta Peters,1.0,"October 7, 2012",Carafe is a stupid design.  Spout is undersize and coffee spills every time you pour.  Coffee on the counter instead of in the cup.
Lisa Hill,4.0,"November 28, 2014","It's a good coffee maker, but the little filter is kind of flimsy, and the clock does not illuminate."

Vikki Beko,5.0,"February 28, 2014",Great product.  This is one of those items I will buy an extra one of for when this one is worn out.
Chris,4.0,"August 13, 2016",bought as replacement of our old coffee maker. The only thing i don'e like on it is it's hard to read the time on the clock. I wish it would light up green or something so it can be seen better( It's black)
Lucille Boyce,5.0,"December 4, 2013",The Mr Coffee coffeemaker brews great coffee and keeps it warm. The caraff does not drip when pouring. It is easy to use.

Robo-tisimo,5.0,"March 3, 2016",I love this coffee maker. It is shorter than most allowing it to fit under my cupboards on the counter. You can program it so your coffee is ready right when you get up.
coffeedrinker,4.0,"November 7, 2011",This coffee maker does its job. I would like the coffee to be hotter than the actual brew. Other than that everything is fine so far.

Kellie Bush,5.0,"April 27, 2016",Makes delicious coffee; great easy to use settings and the programming was a cinch. We also bought the gold filter basket and the water filter disks - so satisfied!
B. N. Becker,5.0,"January 21, 2016","Such a great coffee pot! I went from a Keurig to this because I tended to drink about 2-3 keurig cups a day, i figured I'd just make a pot. The 4 cup  mark on the carafe fills about 1.5 of my mugs. And my mugs aren't that big. The included water filter is easy to use/replace. Everything is easy about it. I didn't even read the directions, and I could figure out all the buttons- and i love that there is a 'brew strength' button- because i love my coffee strong! And I could definitely tell the difference once I figured that function out. I had brewed a couple pots without adjusting that feature, and when I figured out how to adjust it to strong it was great. Highly recommend for it's ease and it looks nice too. Matches all of our stainless steel appliances."

Modjeskan,5.0,"June 29, 2011","RECOMMEND Mr Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12 Cup Programmable Coffeemaker.This coffee maker works great and looks good too. For the price, this is the best 12 cup programmable coffee maker being sold. I read the reviews and this is what I found upon use:1. Yes there are two slots in the back and if you over fill the reservoir, which would be 12 1/2 - 13 cups, it will run all over your counter like some complained.2. The coffee finishes brewing on the Strong setting at 160 degrees in your cup when poured as measured with my instant read thermometer. If some need to nuke that to get it hot enough for them, they have a strong tongue.3. The area to fill the reservoir is behind the basket with a dimension of about 2"" x 5"". You will be pouring into the 2"" dimension from the side of the coffeemaker. I use a Brita water filter pitcher and have no problem. Even the coffee pot works well if you pour it responsibly.4. The coffee basket uses standard 10-12 cup paper filters and is keyed and only goes in 1 way to be able to close the top. The top swings the water spout over the coffee basket when closed.5. The water filter that you place on top of the basket needs to be replaced on a schedule and the water filter retainer has a plastic movable indicator to point to the month when replacement is deemed necessary.6. Yes - water condensates on the lid and if you open it while the hot plate is still on, it will spurt and spit steam into the basket. Luckily the water spout is pointing down when you raise the top. (unlike my last coffeemaker that had the spout in the lid and it spit at you when you opened the top while it was on)7. The buttons do NOT feel cheap. They feel solid and the indicator lites work well and there are 3 pleasant beeps when the coffee is ready.8. Yes - there is a plastic smell when new. I wiped the plastic parts first with a wet rag as recommended and used a couple oz. of vinegar in the water and two rinse cycles. Did this twice with 12 cups of water and it came out OK. But I agree - they could steam clean it or something at the factory before shipping.9. No - the coffee pot doesn't dribble when you pour. (like my last coffeemaker did every time!)10. The basket doesn't drip on the plate if I pull it half way out first and hold for 1-2 seconds before taking it out all the way to give the basket time to close the valve and the drips clear.11. MY ONLY COMPLAINT (as with others) is that my cabinets are 19"" from the counter top and the coffeemaker lid needs 20 1/4"" to swing open. They could have made it slide to the left or accordion fold the top.Overall - the best coffeemaker for the price. Works great. Agree with C. heister review above.Amazon ships this product in it's original box. So if this is a gift, you better let then know or the box will be covered w/ shipping stickers."

Boyd,4.0,"March 2, 2016","This was replacement for my last of many Mr Coffee's. As usual it's a good coffee maker.  But there are a few changes I don't like! First, the change from LED to LCD clock renders it useless!  I need my glasses & a flashlight to see &set it! The old one I could see across the room. Go back to the old clock! Second, a matter of convenience. Why they changed the lid hinge to the left instead of the back. Awkward to fill the water especially for lefties."

David Bland,1.0,"January 2, 2012","I bought this on the strength of the Consumer Reports reviews and regret it. I wish I had read all the negative reviews here on Amazon.  It makes lousy coffee and has a bizarre design that makes it inconvenient at best (below).  If I had kept all the packaging I'd have returned it.Inclued is a water filter that MUST be used or the water will not distribute over the grounds.  The claim is that this filter removes chlorine taste and other impurities but as I have my own water filter I don't need it an cannot vouch for its effectiveness.  This filter unit is the thing the some other reviewers are complaining about -- it's difficult to mount and easily slips down causing the filter to collapse, spilling the goundsI am convinced that the main reason this unit makes such bad coffee is that it does not properly soak the grounds.  Even if you set the water filter properly I don't believe the grounds get wet enough."

And when I'm running out the door and on my way to work, it eases my mind to know it will automatically shut off if I have forgotten to turn it off.  I would recommend this coffee pot to anyone who was looking for simple, easy, good coffee!"
Cynthia Gleason,4.0,"July 29, 2015",So far so good. Was shipped quickly in perfect condition. Coffee is brewed to perfections. I am very satisfied with my new MR Coffee.
Trish,4.0,"August 12, 2014",Purchased as a gift.  I know the receiver has enjoyed it.
Thomas W. Egger,2.0,"September 2, 2017","Purchased in June 2016, stopped working in August 2017.  Previous Mr. Coffee coffee makers lasted at least 2 years or more."
Karen L. O'Harrow,5.0,"April 9, 2013",Purchased about 1 month ago and it works great.  I have not tried any of the replacement cup type holders to eliminate the use of K-cups but I intend to.
Hannah,5.0,"December 15, 2015",So far no complaints or issues in the few months I have had it. Gets the job done and makes great coffee. Saving a ton of money by making coffee at home!
Nate Gordon,5.0,"February 4, 2016","I got this for my parents as a Christmas present as there coffee maker broke on them. Neither of them is tech savvy so I wanted to make sure to get them one they would not struggle with. The verdict, they absolutely love it. I would highly recommend it based on there satisfaction & how easy it is to use. Those were my parents words."
Jeanne Phoenix,5.0,"May 30, 2015","Efficiently designed, and easy to use.Makes great coffee."
LeaAnna Lloyd,5.0,"March 24, 2016",Love this coffee pot. No drips when you pour. It is one of the best ones we have bought.
John Smith,3.0,"July 12, 2015",Good coffee maker does the job. But the UI is terrible. To turn it on you press the off button
Sherrie Romero,5.0,"December 29, 2014",Perfect.
Alexander Stott,2.0,"April 24, 2017","I'm not a daily coffee drinker by any means - so given that, and all the positive reviews, I fully expected this coffee maker to hold up for quite some time. In total, it lasted me 15 months. A few days ago we hit the button, the lights went on, and...nothing. After taking the thing apart and looking for any kind of disconnected part or wire, we realized that some mechanism somewhere was just busted."
abc,1.0,"January 10, 2016","See my original review following..... I am updating the review to indicate that after 8 months it broke. Just died. I used it about 5X per week on average. Will not buy another Mr. Coffee brand product. Original Review: Good overall. Makes coffee. The clock timer has dark grey background and black numerals, so you cannot see the numbers clearly, they don't stand out against the grey background. Also, When looking down on the clock part of the digit is hidden by the set back so a 4 could be a 9' etc. You cannot see the digits clearly unless you bend down, get at eye level to the clock and shine a flashlight on the clock. So we keep a flashlight by the coffee maker. What a stupid design flaw. Perhaps they could start including a flashlight in the package, or maybe, redesign?"
elie215,1.0,"September 13, 2014",Poor quality. Smelled awful. Bulky. Top wouldn't close all the way. I saw high ratings and thought it would be a cheap option. Not worth it.

Shy,1.0,"May 12, 2016","This coffee maker is awful... Leaks coffee everywhere, and takes forever to brew the coffee (seems as if the water and coffee beans get stuck and clog the area that is meant to drain into the pot). Definitely going to get rid of this and invest in a Keurig."
Kelly,5.0,"June 23, 2015",Love this coffee pot.  We had a regular 12 cup programmable Mr. Coffee for the past 6 years and this one goes way above and beyond that one and we loved that one.
Rayanne Edwards,2.0,"February 12, 2016","Not even three months old & the coffee maker has quit working, VERY poor quality.  Don't buy this Mr. Coffee"
Nick,5.0,"January 16, 2016","This is your straight-forward drip coffee machine. If you're looking for espresso and such, look elsewhere as obviously this isn't for coffee snobs. I've had this for a few months with no problems - the delay timer is pretty simple to use as well and it's a cheap device ($34 when I bought it but at the time of this posting has dropped to $29).Today, the coffee maker stopped working entirely, likely an issue with the heating element. Since none of the manual's troubleshooting directions worked, I called up Mr. Coffee's customer service center where the friendly customer service representative Terry took my information and promptly put in an order for a replacement machine at no cost to me. The whole process took about 5 minutes and was unlike few other customer service experience's I've had. I didn't even have to send the old machine back. On the whole, what would have lead to a single star review of the device is now a 5 star due to this unparalleled customer service."

Bonnie J. Lindsey,5.0,"June 8, 2011",The coffee maker was easy to program and is easy to use.  I like the feature whereI can select brew strength.  Use of the filter does not seem to add to or takeaway from the quality of the coffee.  I would recommend it.
Dan D,1.0,"October 2, 2014",The morons set me a coffee maker without a pot
Scott,5.0,"February 21, 2016",Great coffee machine.  Does everything I need (and more).  Bought it on Amazon for ten dollars less than my local department store.
J. K.,2.0,"January 24, 2016",Had it a few months. The extra plastic taste is gone. The water is not super dooper hot but the coffee does get strong enough. My label on the front is up-side-down and the corporation said to leave it. Coffee maker drips when you take pot away. Good on a budget if you are not picky: it makes coffee. Tip: put tea bags in the top instead for an even brew of hot tea at up to 12 cups of water.Update - died after almost three years.
ZMCatz,5.0,"March 10, 2016",It's a coffee machine. And it makes good coffee! My criteria was an easy-to-use programmable function. And this machine has that. So... Great!

Bud Nedry,3.0,"February 6, 2013","Ad stated the coffee maker had higher heating capacity than others.  I still have to heat my coffee in the microwave to get the flavor released.  Warm water does not, in my opinion,  heat the coffee enough to release the full flavor.When are the mfgrs. Going to get over the woman placing hot coffee between her legs and make hot coffee again.  It's impossible to get a hot cup of coffee in a restaurant anymore.  I just drink water rather than paying $3.00 to $8.00 for a cup of tepid coffee."

Kenny,5.0,"April 29, 2016",It gets coffee really hot which I love. Works great overall.
Granna54,1.0,"May 5, 2011","This is the worst coffee pot I have ever owned. I thought it can't be that bad from the other reviews, I was wrong it's very messy to be honest I can't even believe mr coffee would put out such a product. Makes great tasting coffee but when you pull out pot for a cup before pot is completely brewed the flow does not stop as advertised it sizzles on the hot plate. When you fill it with water it flows thru so you better have a rag on hotplate to catch it til you can put pot back in for brewing. To be honest I should return it but my other pot went out and it would leave me without coffee til I recieved a replacement take heed this is one pot you do NOT want to purchase!!"

Only make coffee in the mornings, so it isn't used all day everyday.  Bought this one online because it was easier for me at the time.  Will probably buy again when this one quits.  They last about a year, or maybe a little less.  But for the money it does its job."

Stew,1.0,"November 25, 2013",Coffee maker a bargain and definitely has great reviews.  It worked as advertised.  Especially liked the ease in which you added the water and coffee.  The coffee was brewed hot but did not keep temperature more than 30 minutes after brewing.  Purchased just 30 days ago and yesterday it only brews steam.  Too late for Amazon return and now waiting to see if Mr. Coffee honors their warranty.

Richard,1.0,"January 3, 2014",The coffee pot lasted only 2 months. When brewing coffee the water reservoir will only empty to the 4 cup mark. It then no longer delivers the water to the coffee basket but just boils away in the reservoir.
Rudytude,1.0,"January 11, 2012","I have had many Mr. Coffee Brand coffee makers and this is the worst one yet.  You cannot see the digital display for the time. It does not light up.  So if it is in the dark area of a room, don't bother trying to read it.  The basket that holds the grounds has to be in it's position just right because you can close the lid and the spout will go over the basket.  However, if it is not all the way down in its slot, you will wake up to coffee and the grounds all over your counter."
Crickkett75,3.0,"December 21, 2015","Finished brewing timer goes off before the coffee has finished brewing, temp of the coffee temp is only warm, and stronger brewing feature is no different than normal brew. The one feature that I do like is the side water refill."

Lori B,4.0,"March 12, 2016","This coffee pot has a lot of great options, the only thing is that you need to make sure your coffee filter insert is set correctly each time you make a pot or you can easily make it overflow if it's not sitting in place correctly.  You have an option to select regular or strong which is really nice. It does seem to turn off very early, but we just pour it in a carafe after about 30 minutes to keep the coffee hot."
Amazon Customer,5.0,"January 31, 2016",This is a great coffe maker does what it says. People saying about the plastic smell is because it's new. I ran vinigar & water through it first it took the smell out. Then made a pot of coffee . The coffee maker made a great cup of coffee.

ralph perkins,4.0,"March 13, 2016","Well, the first one I got didn't work at all.  So I sent it back.  The replacement works and it does what its supposed to do.  All the functions are easy to use.  I agree with some others that there was a plastic taste and smell at first but after two or three cycles with plain water it diminished and after a while was completely gone.  One thing to note:  It uses about a cup in the brewing process, so if you want to make 12 cups you need to fill the tank past the full line."
Gimger Vance,1.0,"June 25, 2014",The coffee maker only worked once and then failed.  Totally unsatisfactory and we had to buy another brand within a week of purchase.

toni kasper,4.0,"January 31, 2016",Love the coffee pot. Nice sleek design.  The only thing I don't like is having to buy the extra filter to filter the water.  It does make the coffe taste better but I font need another thing to purchase or change once a month.
Amazon Customer,5.0,"January 27, 2016","Its a coffee machine. Makes coffee, doesnt complain, and has all the important features of a modern coffee machine"
MJH,2.0,"November 16, 2014",I ended up returning it because of two major flaws.1. You cannot turn off the burner during brewing because this unit heats the water by passing it through a rubber hose and then into a metal coil which heated by the hot plate burner. You cannot turn off the burner after doing a timed brew without purchasing the metal carafe for an additional cost (You get around this by placing a magnet at the back of the burner to make the coffee maker sensor think you are using the carafe)2. The burner and the water get extremely hot which gives the coffee a horrible burned flavor and also causes the burning plastic smell that most of the other reviews mention. I measured the temperature of the burner using an infrared thermometer and it showed over 700 degrees. Everyone knows to make a good cup of coffee you never want the water to go above 200 degrees.

Shirley H.,1.0,"February 25, 2014","If you want strong coffee, forget this machine.  We will donate this to some organization with a caveat about brew strength.  No matter what you do, add more coffee, change the water, etc., it is simply not capable of making a strong cup of coffee.  Very, very disappointing.I would definitely not recommend this machine."

Previous reviews have addressed the water meter located on the side and while this is a nuisance it is just that - a nuisance.  I bought this model expecting to be able to set the automatic shut down within a two hour range, as in a previous model.  Unfortunately this model is set to turn off at the two mark only, at which time the coffee is bitter and I'm left frustrated."

All the lights go on but no heating of the element or warming tray; therefore, no brew.  I was really thrilled to be given the phone number for Mr Coffee through Amazon customer service and their response was excellent.  They are sending a new coffeemaker, the updated model.  We are really impressed!"

larry b,2.0,"December 6, 2012","This machine is designed well and we liked the way it looks (this is what gives it 2 stars), but if you like the taste of a good cup of coffee, then you should look at other coffee makers. This one has a bad plastic smell AND taste that ruins the coffee flavor, and I am not talking about a ""new"" plastic smell that will go away, it doesn't. It seems to be much worse when the unit is brewing because of the heat. I have had Mr. Coffee units as well as other brands in the past and never had a problem like this one. My recommendation, do not buy, it isn't worth the hassle of having to return it. I should have listened to the reviews of others, but thought that it was probably not too bad. I was wrong, it ruins the coffee. I do not know what was going on when Consumer Reports did their review on this unit (number 1 ???) but they must have had a different machine or the testers had no sense of taste.???"

folmonty,1.0,"May 4, 2014",After purchasing this coffee maker I decided to stick with a cone basket instead of the Mr. Coffee flat basket.  Just makes more sense that all the water goes through the entire amount of grounds.  This isn't a slam on Mr. Coffee just a basic lesson in physics.  My mistake Mr. Coffee.  BTW - one star isn't really fair since we never really took it out of the box.  We use a basket style Mr. Coffee for travel and it works just fine.  Did we over think this whole coffee maker purchase.  Maybe so?

D. Diggler,3.0,"December 13, 2012","Update 9/8/15: Consumer Reports magazine no longer recommends this coffeemaker because it no longer heats water reliably to the temperature required (195° to 205° F for five to six minutes) to nominally extract flavor from coffee grounds:""Because the new models of the Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT no longer measure up, it is dropping in our Ratings from a recommended model to lower in the pack.""Update 1/24/15 - after 2 years of daily use:LCD clock display has not failed due to condensation on its face. Impressive!Filter clogging with colossal spillage over rim of basket - never happened.No hint of plastic smell/taste after the first few brews: There was some when first used, but no more after that.Never had a mildew smell.Only big change is that the warming plate at base is corroding / turning brown. But I have a Cuisinart that does that, too.Conclusion: unit is working the same as when new. Totally satisfied. If it dies tomorrow, I'd buy another without delay - unless of course I saw better reviews for a different unit. Thanks all for your helpful comments!Original review December 2012:After using this Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT coffeemaker for a week, I thought I would attempt to address some of the complaints that other reviewers had on this coffeemaker. Some of the complaints are valid, others, well, it seems like they're describing a different unit altogether, or at the very least a defective one or a different production run than mine. Here we go:1. Coffee overflowing out of the basket and into the reservoir and out to the countertop: I did not experience this. This could theoretically happen if one were to accidentally use 2 paper filters, which could reduce the rate of coffee going through the basket, which would then create an overflow situation. This scenario would not be limited to this coffeemaker, then. Overflow could also happen if one were to accidentally allow grounds to go into or remain in the plastic basket, which could clog it. Again, not particular to this coffeemaker. Could also happen if the carafe were incorrectly placed in the coffeemaker: not likely at all (see below).2. Length of brew time too long: No reviewers stated how many minutes per batch, or how many cups and minutes per batch. This unit seemed to take a reasonable amount of time - the same amount of time that my Cuisinart maker takes.3. Brewed coffee not hot enough: Using a good candy thermometer, I measured the temperature of a brewed pot of coffee (while in its glass carafe) immediately after brewing: 175 degrees. Scalding hot. Temperature dropped to 155 degrees within 5 minutes. Suggestion: to keep your coffee hot,  move coffee to a hot-charged, insulated carafe immediately after brewing.4. Plastic smell while brewing, plastic taste of brewed coffee: I definitely got the strong plastic smell with the first couple of water-only ""prep"" no-coffee brew cycles, and a bit less with the first few coffee cycles. This smell is no longer present after 6 days of use. Plastic taste: I did notice a slight plastic aftertaste with the first few coffee batches, but no longer. I suppose I may have gotten used to it, or it is no longer happening, or a combination of both. I think that it is the latter case.5. Coffee leaks from basket onto the warming plate while using ""pause and serve"" feature (sneaking a cup of coffee during brewing cycle): I saw two or three drops of coffee go onto the warming plate: not too bad. Quick swipe with a damp paper towel keeps the plate clean. Not a defect.6. Warming plate not hot enough, no temperature setting for plate: I do not use the warming plate - my coffee goes directly from the pot to an insulated carafe right after brewing. Applied post-brewed heat is the enemy of brewed coffee. The longer you keep your brewed coffee on *any* warming plate - regardless of temperature - the worse it will taste.7. Correct carafe placement onto warming plate is difficult and likely to cause basket overflow: Despite my best, repeated efforts, I could not *incorrectly* place the pot onto the plate. The pot placed itself into its home 100 percent of the time. The only way I could get it to *not* place itself correctly was to barely balance it on the front edge of the maker, which was difficult in itself.8. LCD Clock display not illuminated: True. A definite shortcoming of this unit, especially considering this is a programmable unit. A missed necessity.9. Condensation on clock and buttons on front operating panel: True. Could have long-term reliability consequences.10. Water spout not positioned properly over grounds: Impossible! The closure of the unit's lid  forces (rotates) the spout into the correct position - that is of course unless one does not close the lid.11. Filter paper collapse and fold-over onto grounds in basket, causing clog and overspill: It could happen, since I have experienced this with other drip makers. Not particular to this unit, then.12. 2 hours post-brew auto-shutoff - too soon?: Nope. Coffee cooking for 2 hours on a warming plate would taste horrible. Want hot coffee two hours later? Move it from the pot to an insulated carafe directly after completion of brewing cycle. I would actually prefer that there were no warming unit on this machine.13. Power cord length too short: It measures exactly 24 inches from the back middle of the unit to the male power plug. Dealbreaker? Not for many, I'm guessing.14. Water filter placement onto top of brewing basket is difficult: Agreed. Must be done carefully. I chose to not use the filter at all, since I use purified water already. Plus, by not using the water filter, it's one more step I don't need to perform. Hot water seems to distribute nicely onto grounds without it - all of the grounds in the basket are soaking wet after the brewing cycle is complete.15. Amount of coffee brewed is much less than amount of water used: After multiple 8-cup water brews, I consistently yielded 7.75 cups per batch. That's about 3 percent water loss to evaporation. Insignificant. Any more loss than that, then there must be some other cause at play. I could not cajole my unit to lose any more water than was lost to evaporation.16. Condensation of water in reservoir after brewing creates musty or mildew smell: It could happen in theory. I leave the lid open after brewing for a while to avoid this possibility. Again, this scenario would not be limited to this unit.17. Reliability after several months: Unknown. Only had it a week.18. Amount of coffee needed to produce a given coffee strength: My unit yields similar strength as on my Cuisinart maker given the same amount of grounds/water/grind fine-ness.Summary: It seems that some of the complaints are totally unrealistic (IMHO), but others are totally valid. I hope this helps!"

real consumer,1.0,"May 4, 2012","This product is so bad I took the time to warn you about it. I dismissed the review that mentioned the ""plastic taste"" and I'm sorry I did. Not only is there a nauseous taste, but the smell and aftertaste won't go away even after I cleaned the unit. Filling the reservoir to 12 cups only yields 10 cups, probably because the remaining water leaks from somewhere all over the counter. The carafe sucks as well. Drips is an understatement. Worst coffee maker and worst cup of coffee I ever tasted."

Ben Waller,4.0,"November 5, 2013","Please note - my review is not based on any sort of experience with this coffee maker. I haven't used it yet.When I purchased this coffee maker, it was in fact, one of two coffee makers in my order. I also purchased a french press. You might be wondering why would a man need TWO coffee makers? Shouldn't one be enough?The answer, my fine friends, is ""The Ladies.""You see, when women spend the night, I need to make sure that they know that I appreciate the finer things in life. Such as french press coffee. You might think this reflects negatively on this coffee maker. You'd be wrong - these are for mornings when this hot shot is on the go.To update you all - I broke the french press. This is no doubt due to the copious amounts of ladies I slayed (other Amazon purchases of mine include: 100-pack of condoms.)This coffee maker, as stated before, hasn't been used."
presha shah,5.0,"September 21, 2014",Nice product. Happy to receive it for such a low price.
Sim Harbert,1.0,"July 4, 2012","The reviews are so polar on this item that I can only assume something changed in the production of this item.  I decided to buy hoping that the bad reviewers were wrong about the acrid, horrible smell.The coffee maker is quite nice to use, and I would keep it if the smell wasn't there.  I, too, found that it puts off a terrible smell that continued pot after pot of water that I ran through it.  I must have done 10 pots of water and made several batches of coffee that had the smell.  It seemed to just get worse.I took the little tube out that ran the water up to the basket, and found out why it brews so slowly.  There are probably supposed to be o-rings around the tube to seal the tube against the swiveling spout, but they were missing.  When brewing, a lot of water leaks back into the water reservoir instead of going out of the spout.  That tube or something related may have changed and may also be the source of the terrible smell.I can only assume that the production of this product changed at some point, perhaps to save money.  Instead they have created an unusable product that I returned."
Daniel A Berry,5.0,"April 27, 2011","Our old reliable and inexpensive Mr. Coffee maker had served us well for almost 12 years, but finally the plastic started to show it's age and could no longer resist the daily abuse.  The result was the carafe handle and the one of the filter pegs recently breaking.  The coffee maker still worked great but clearly it was time for a new one...Let me preface this review by saying that I had two very important criteria when I was looking for a new coffeemaker:1. Must have a thermal carafe. (wife wanted it)2. Must use basket filters. (I still have several hundred of them, bought in bulk long ago, so I want to use them!)Price was also a criteria, of course, but I was open to spending over $100 if necessary to get a good one.  I have a soft spot for Mr. Coffee based on the long and reliable life of our old one, but I looked at all the brands with models matching the above two criteria.Those two criteria really managed to limit the number of models I had to consider and I didn't see any real outstanding reviews on any of them, even the ones priced over $100.  Then I stumbled upon this little gem.  The reviews were good, it uses basket filters, and provides the option of buying a thermal carafe.  The price is so low that even with the extra bucks to buy the thermal carafe it was still cheaper than pretty much all of the other models I had looked at.  Plus it is Mr. Coffee, which has served us so well for so many years.  Sold.So, with the story of how I came to purchase it out of the way I can get on to the heart of the review...First off the coffee maker looks great; sleek and compact.  It actually takes up less space than the old Mr. Coffee model that it replaced.The instructions are very straightforward and it is very simple to operate.  It doesn't have a lot of fancy settings or other complications. It includes a water filter but since we already filter our water I opted not to use it.  Before using you are advised to run it through a brew cycle with just water to get rid of any manufacturing residues.  You can definitely pick up some chemical smells right out of the box so I opted to run a couple of brew cycles just to be safe.  After two cycles it was ready to make coffee.Making coffee is a snap.  The filter basket lifts out easily - you just rotate the spray arm out of the way and lift out.  This makes it easy to add the ground coffee and to clean up afterwards.  After you have the filter basket loaded up with ground coffee you just put it back in and rotate the spray arm back into place.  You add the water into the reservoir through the same opening in the top and there is plenty of room to pour.  The cup markings are on the right side of the machine and may be a little difficult to see in low light, but I haven't had any trouble.  If you measure your water before adding it then it won't matter in any case.  Once you have added the water you just press one button to start brewing.  If you want to change the brew strength you press one more.  The machine will beep when it is done. Easy.The unit automatically senses whether you are using the glass or thermal carafe.  The heating element turns on only for the glass carafe since the whole idea of the thermal carafe is to keep the coffee warm without continually heating it.  We typically use the glass carafe when we are going to drink up the coffee quickly and the thermal when we have more time and want to drink coffee at our leisure.  The thermal carafe easily keeps the coffee warm enough for us for a couple of hours.  The instructions advise pre-heating the carafe with hot water to help maintain the temperature but we usually don't bother.This machine brews great tasting coffee quickly and easily.  If that is what you want in a coffeemaker then I highly recommend it.  If you want lots of fancy settings to fiddle around with then it isn't for you.  The clock on the machine is not illuminated so you can't see it at night.  If you really want/need an illuminated clock then you will want to find another model.This coffeemaker suits our needs perfectly and the price can't be beat.  The optional thermal carafe is great for keeping coffee warm without cooking it - perfect for extended coffee drinking sessions."

H. Grant,2.0,"November 29, 2012","Now before I rant too much, this is probably my fault for not researching is product more thoroughly.  But wouldn't you think they would include a filter or at the very least one paper filter in the box?  Beware, when you porchase this item you must buy a permanent filter, which in recommended in the instructions, or a supply of paper filters.  Granted this isn't the most expensive coffee maker and it is a Mr Coffee and it is recommended by Consumer Reports.  But how cheap can they be by not including even one paper filter.  So, it's another trip to Bed Bath and Beyond.  I just hope this isn't indicative of the overall quality of the product."
Amy,1.0,"May 22, 2011","I've owned various Mr. Coffee coffee makers through the years and never have I had the problems I had with this.  Let me start off by saying that I purchased 2 of these.  One for coffee & the other for tea.  My family drinks a large amount of tea and it's just so much easier to run the water through a coffee pot that will keep the tea water hot for a longer period of time then having use the teapot every time you want a cup.The pots arrived on Friday (it's Sunday when I'm writing this review & the pots are already boxed for return). I was excited and I unboxed the first pot right away. When I set it up I noticed a funny plastic smell when I opened the unit up to pour in the water.  I've had pots with this problem before, so I ran a water/vinegar mixture through the pot twice, dumped that out and then ran two pots of just plain water to get rid of the vinegar taste/smell.  I'm sad to say that it did absolutely nothing.  The unit still stunk and the water that came out of the pot had a foul disgusting plastic taste to it.  Figuring that since I was using a pot for water only the taste would be more prominate, so I redid the vinegar/water mixture three more times (each time using more and more vinegar).  Unfortunately, it did nothing to make the taste better.  I then switched and tried a water/lemon juice mixture I found after some research on line.  Still no change.  The unit still reaked and the water tasted foul.I boxed up that unit and figured, ok, let me try the second unit.  That unit was just as bad.  It had the same foul odor and funky water taste. (And no, it's got nothing to do with the water as my house water tastes fine & I drink it all the time).To anyone who chooses to disregard the 1 star reviews (I did the same figuring that the problems the others had were ones that wouldn't really bother me and things I could work around), I implore you, test the pot out with plain water first.  Coffee may mask the funky taste, but I can't imagine that anything that would produce a plastic taste like this could be healthy for you in any way shape or form.For shame on you Mr. Coffee, for shame."
J,3.0,"September 30, 2011","Pluses include a nice looking coffee maker with easy controls. However, many cycles with plain water together with several sessions of airing out the open machine in the hot sun and breeze were required to get rid of the distracting odor and flavor of the plastic components contacted by the water.  Instructions describe a woefully inadequate pretreatment process prior to making coffee.  Others have remarked on this disagreeable feature.  I should have paid attention to their comments.  Also, the carafe and basket must be placed exactly correct in the machine with little margin of error or else you will have a flood with coffee grounds and water all over the counter.  Because the clock is not backlit, it is difficult to read.  Having said all this, the machine is now making decent coffee."
John E Pyla,1.0,"May 3, 2014","Not pleased when you see this in a store the clock lights up, So this model does not so it sucks"
N. Richardson,1.0,"August 19, 2020","I have had this coffee maker for 2 years but has been in service for only 2 weeks. I purchased this coffee maker 2 years ago to have as a backup. When I put the maker into service 2 weeks ago I was hoping it would last a couple of years (the average life of a coffee maker) not just a couple of weeks. At first, I noticed moisture building up in clock display, then the delay brew stopped working, then started turning itself on and off, then complete death. I have used Mr. Coffee products for over 40 years and this one is just about enough for me to want to try another brand. But, I will give Mr. Coffee 1 more chance. I give this unit 1 star but it deserves a -10."
Dad's Garage,3.0,"August 12, 2016","This coffee maker uses a bottom warming element. I was under the impression that it did not because it has a thermal carafe as optional equipment. My old Zojirushi convinced me that continuing to ""cook"" coffee after brewing degraded its flavor when left on after some time. Moreover, when coffee spills onto the warmer, it burns leaving a foul odor in the air. I should have bought another"
C. D. Koehler,5.0,"February 20, 2015","This coffee pot is sleek and convenient.  I can easily see why it is the Number One seller on Amazon.  It is well priced and the performance and options available make this unit great.  The delay brew (aka timer setting) is a feature I look for in coffee pots because I like to wake up to fresh brewed coffee.  The exterior is sleek and fits well in any kitchen with black or chrome appliances.  There are many options to this machine also.  You can get the optional thermal carafe (available on Amazon too), although I find it currently unnecessary as there is a 2-hour built in warmer.  The machine comes with a water filter that is designed to be replaced once a month but it is rather a nuisance because it simply gets placed on top of the filter basket so you need to remove it and replace it every time you prepare a new pot.  I will stop using it after this first month since I use filtered water to begin with. The water reservoir is placed in the back of the unit but it is large so makes pouring water into it very easy.  This was a major upgrade over the Krups one I had before that cost double and was constantly getting clogged.The only con is that this unit does not have a backlight on the clock."
Mr.&Mrs. Sleepyhead,4.0,"June 19, 2012","First, let me address the common complaints of others: The odor, for me, after a simple cleaning + a diluted vinegar run, was so insignificant that I did not notice any altered flavor to my coffee - however, I am not very finicky.  The water filter was not difficult or tricky to place, neither was the basket: there are notches to ensure proper, secure placement.  The coffee pot does not ""dribble"" unless you try to dump the whole thing at once. Now for the ones I agree with: The side opening lid on such a tall coffeemaker is awkward unless you have tall cabinets, and no backlight on the clock can make it difficult to see in poor light. The only problem I find truly annoying is this: when you open the lid to refill the water, the considerable condensation from the last batch can sometimes escape and dribble down the coffeemaker.  I've only used my pot for a few days, it was so easy to program that, even though it had been nearly a decade since I had used a programmable coffeemaker, I didn't even have to read the instructions to do it, and it worked perfectly.  I like the ""I'm ready"" alarm, and the shut off alarm, although some may find it annoying - they are as loud as a microwave beep.  The machine actually seems less cheaply made than the $100+ single cup models I saw(you Know the Kind I mean), the buttons are easy to use, and the shape is pretty space conscious.  I bought the red one, and it is gorgeous.  I am very happy with my choice, hope this review helps you! :)"
StarCraft Faucet Reviews,5.0,"August 14, 2013","The danger of writing a glowing review of an appliance is that everyone assumes the reviewer is associated with the manufacturer, and is just pumping up the product.  I'm not.  I am a remodeling contractor in Lincoln, NE, and as far as I know don't even own stock in Mr. Coffee.I bought this maker after reading a review in Consumer Reports that rated the appliance second best, but by far the best buy.  The first best was many hundreds of dollars.The review was correct.  It makes excellent coffee, and at the price, everyone should stock up with two or more for the inevitable day when the appliance fails, as it will, eventually.To be fair, the item we received did not have a working timer circuit.  So, the clock, brew timer and automatic warmer shutoff (all connected to the timer circuit) did not work.  I called Mr. Coffee warranty service and asked for a replacement, which was sent no questions asked.  They did not even want the defective appliance back -- so I gave it to the Salvation Army for someone who wants a good coffeemaker but does not need a timer.The maker is quick and easy to load.  Someone in another review mentioned that he cannot pour water or coffee out of the carafe without it dripping everywhere.  I don't know what he's doing.  Pour it fast or slow, and it never drips -- best carafe I have ever seen.Because I am a contractor and buy a lot of appliances, I get most such things wholesale, and have owned a few very expensive coffee makers (construction people drink a lot of coffee), including Braun, Keurig, Cuisinart, and Bunn costing as much as $400.00.  I think for the price (under $40.00), this is the best I have ever owned, and by far the least expensive.A note on Mr. Coffee's customer service.  It used to get bad marks.  But, my recent experience suggests that it has improved markedly.I have had this maker in service for about 4 months, so I cannot attest to its durability or longevity.  I am always suspicious of appliances made in China, but can say that this one gets a lot of use -- probably equivalent to about 1 year in a normal household -- and has, so far, held up well.I have no hesitation recommending this product."
Allen Smalling,5.0,"February 24, 2015","Is this the same Mr. Coffee model BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable (Chrome) that other people have downrated so severely?  There was no odor of plastic while brewing -- we just unpacked the machine and ran cold water through it --  no stench at all.  The coffee is nice and hot, which is essentially why we decided to ""decommission"" the old Rival. (We like piping hot coffee, and I must wonder if there are federal regs that limit the upper temperature of home-brewed coffee?)  We actually use less coffee than before (five coffee scoops for a full pot, whereas we used six before) so honestly, the people who say the coffee is consistently weak baffle me, especially since the coffee maker has ""Strong"" and ""Regular"" settings.  I can only figure that these coffee makers come out of two different factories, OR perhaps some buyers have traded down from a more ""Continental"" type of maker with a cone basket and a smaller, ""fluffier"" grind of coffee?  That might account for the coffee grounds some folks have found in their coffee.  If indeed you are unused to the American ""basket"" type of filter, count on grinding your coffee a little more coarsely than the Euro norm (for example, we use a no. 4 grind from Zabar's).Two weeks have made us very happy with this maker.  To get all this -- programmability, hot fresh coffee, the gadgets like Strong/Regular setting and its own little water filter -- at this price seems a very nice thing indeed.  The only thing I mark as a potential liabilty is that, when empty, this coffee marker is lighter than one would expect from all the ""doodads.""  It LOOKS like a Bunn-for-the-home (unplumbed) or a European marque; but it WEIGHS like our old Rival.  (It also COSTS in the budget range, too.)  Let's see how long it lasts:  One Mr. Coffee and one Norelco served us for most of our 25 years of joint housekeeping.  If this one conks within a year like the ""free"" ones from a certain Midwestern purveyor of Scandinavian coffee did, I'll amend this review.  As for now, five stars,  very pleased."
Lisa Kearns,4.0,"April 30, 2016","I bought this coffeemaker at Costco for $29.99, to replace our Cuisinart DCC-2650 ($99.95), which was a giant piece of junk. We had two of them die in just a few months (with Cuisinart expecting us to pay to ship the defective item to them, and also pay a replacement fee of $20) and I'm tired of paying more for ""better quality"" only to have it fail.This Mr. Coffee is programmable, which is my first priority in choosing a coffeemaker. My husband gets up at 3:30 a.m. for work and needs to have coffee ready to drink and to put in his thermos. After that, we look for cup capacity, attractive design and cost. So far this Mr. Coffee has been perfect. It comes on when it's supposed to, brews a strong pot of coffee (selecting the bold brew button) and brews the pot in less than 15 minutes.I really hate how everything has become disposable - replace it every year or two. But I had a basic Mr. Coffee decades ago that faithfully made my coffee (without a timer or clock), and I think it's time I accepted that I'll be replacing our coffeepot every few years. As long as it does what it's supposed to I'll try to be happy. And no more high-dollar Cuisinart junk for me.Edited May30, 2016:  I'm taking a star away from this coffeemaker because we've been having trouble with the solid-bottom filter basket.  It doesn't let the coffee drain into the pot fast enough, which allows coffee and grounds to back up into the machine, on the hotplate and counter top.  What a mess to wake up to!  I've been searching for a replacement filter basket that isn't solid on the bottom but I can't find one.  We started using paper filters in it, and it works perfectly."
AUTISTIC WEREWOLF,5.0,"October 10, 2014","My neighbor has this exact coffee maker.  On my visits the answers always yes when I am asked Wolf would you like some coffee.  Their Mr. Coffee makes coffee so good that it just blows me away.  This Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Chrome is cute and small and does not take up lots of counter real estate.  Also I am going to be working from home 2 days a week now so I will need coffee to stay awake during work hours.  My grandparents had a Mr. Coffee maker back in the 1990's and that thing was a tank, that made coffee like a trooper for years without fail.  I think it was fully 9 years old when it died.  If you get a good Mr. Coffee you can expect it to last for years of trouble free operation.  If you get a Mr. Coffee made by the village idiot then you will likely have problems that is the luck of the draw.This Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Chrome coffee maker has so many push buttons and new fangled things but it does NOT seem like they loused up the ease of use functions.  The coffee is kept hot so you don't have to worry about it going cold.  The system turns the warming element off after a few hours.  Two hours is a reasonable sell by date for warmed coffee unless you work in public safety where coffee often grows so old it can stand on its own.  The coffee maker looks good too if you have a comptempary kitchen or decor.The coffee itself is still killer good IF you buy quality beans to start with.  Me I love the house brand where I shop one of them posh uppity stores that grinds your coffee while you wait. Add fresh cream, a hint of sugar and you are set.."
Kaye,5.0,"April 13, 2013","We bought our Mr. Coffee at Walmart.  Didn't have time to wait, the other machine we had quit suddenly and we can't deal without morning coffee!!!I pretty much like this machine.  What I don't like, that the water tank window is on the wrong side for our counter.  I either have to turn the unit or walk around to the back to fill.  However, IF you don't overfill the pot and use the pot that it comes with to fill it, it's kind of a non issue as it won't overfill.  There is also a handy little ""stair step"" thing on the lefthand side that you can see that will help you to not overfill.  I am forced to be very careful because the pouring ""target area"" is rather small.Yes the first pot through did have a bit of a plastic taste.  Today, second pot that is almost gone.  I may run some cleaner through it today, just to insure that the plastic smell/taste is gone.My main gripe at the moment is:  After the machine made coffee this morning, I found that there was condensation on the inside of the clock's viewing window.  That DOES bother me and I've written to the company about it.  I would have thought that area would be well sealed off.  It's odd because yesterday, after running two pots of clear water through and then brewing a pot of coffee, this didn't happen!!  For this reason, and because we haven't really had it long enough to judge if some of these issues will resolve themselves, I gave this machine only 4 stars.UPDATE!!I am not sure why the clock had condensation on it, but it only did that one time.  No plastic taste or smell at all now.  I ran my regular coffee machine cleaner through it, followed by three pots of clean water.  Nothing now but tasty coffee.  The timer works great.  I am going to buy it a thermal carafe I think.  After two hours the coffee tends to taste a little ""over done"", but that was expected.  Pouring the water is now a lot easiser, just took some getting used to.  I did buy a permant filter to add to the filter basket and some regular paper filters (I use them inside the permanent filter).  Everything to date is working as it should.So...Now this unit is 5 stars in my book!!  Their customer service is great btw!!"
HB,2.0,"September 19, 2012","I'll keep this simple. We really disliked this coffee maker and are planning to return it. Here are the pros and cons:PROS:- Easy to program and the programming works. It will brew your coffee on time in the morning, however you set it.CONS:- Carafe drips and spills every time.- Coffee grounds get into the carafe every time, whether you're making a big pot or a small pot.- It does not keep coffee hot. It has a hot plate that stays on for 2 hours but the coffee is luke warm at best after just an hour.- I purchased the optional thermal pot and that does better but you have to practically turn the pot upside down to get all the coffee out of it. The lid also doesn't have enough threading. In other words, if you don't unscrew it enough the coffee doesn't come out, if you unscrew it too much it falls off when you pour. The space between those two points is small, so its hard to get it right.- It has a fairly large foot print and its awkward to get water into the back of it. There is only one spot to pour that is wide enough to avoid water either spilling off the back of the unit or over the edge into the grounds basket and its not a very large space at that. It's kind of precarious and you have to pour at an awkward angle.- The strong brew isn't much stronger than the standard brew.- Seems to brew coffee at different levels of strength even if you put in the same amount of grounds and water every time. For example, I put in 4 tablespoons of grounds for 4 cups of water. Sometimes that comes out like a regular coffee and sometimes it comes out really weak and watered down. I never know which I am going to get.There are probably a few other things I just don't like about this machine but I think you get my point. Perhaps the biggest disappointment is that it simply doesn't brew a good cup of coffee. If you simply tolerate coffee in the morning to wake you up, then this machine might be ok for you if you can get over all the little quirks. But if you are the kind of person who savors coffee and wants to wake up and really enjoy a cup, you should definitely pass on this. I found myself just not wanting to use it.We've moved on to a french press and espresso machine we got at a thrift store for the same price as this machine and we are so much happier."
J. Luppes,5.0,"October 3, 2014","Makes really good coffee - it's obviously still a drip machine, so it's not making espressos or anything fancy, but the drip pots it puts out are as good as any I've had with this type of device, and it brews pretty quickly even in strong-brew mode - I can usually have a cup out of it just two or three minutes after starting the cycle. Friends often compliment the coffee I give them from this unit (I use nice beans so that helps, but those can still be ruined by a bad machine). It's note quite to the level of what I can pull off with an Aeropress (my favorite, a tiny bit labor intensive and only makes ~2-3 cups at a time espresso-style), french press (very cleaning-intensive, lots of grounds), or pour-over (still getting the hang of this one), but can make a LOT more at a time than any of those methods, which is great if serving a lot of people or wanting a few cups (esp. taking some on the road).Has a timer mode, water filter, removable basket, and strong-brew mode, which were all requirements for me.I appreciate the ability to use a metal carafe (and that the unit will apparently auto-detect it when you switch), though I don't have one and haven't tried this feature.Clock is not incredibly easy to read when below eye-level, but clocks are not exactly in short supply these days so I really only use it to set the timer.Water runs down the pot a bit when pouring into the reservoir quickly, but if I just pour a little slower it's not really much of an issue.Filter replacements are a little expensive from the manufacturer, but third-party ones are pretty cheap and work just fine.Buttons are relatively easy to use, a little confusing to anyone who hasn't used them before, but not bad. The buttons all click nicely when pushed, so starting a pot always feels great.Overall quite please with this unit. Has all the features I want from a drip machine and makes good coffee.Looks pretty darn nice too."
FL Reader,4.0,"December 27, 2014",I started out unsure if I should buy this product after reading mixed reviews - one week later I am glad I did.  Makes as good a cup of coffee as I would want and have not experienced a single problem.  I particularly like the side opening top - makes it much easier to fill with water than other coffee makers I have been using.  And well designed - when the top is closed the water dispenser is pushed into position automatically.  I can dispel some of the negatives I read:  There were claims the carafe would not pour without spilling - not true - pours without a problem.  There were claims the coffee brewing was uneven - not true - all the coffee grounds are adequately covered with hot water during brewing as the cycle progresses.  There were claims about a plastic smell - well sure the coffee maker is made of plastic so it will always have a slight smell if you stick your nose into it - but after an initial cleaning (with vinegar) and a couple of brew cycles with only water there is no hint of a plastic smell or taste to the coffee.  Beeping when cycle is done and at shutdown are helpful.  Water fill level on the side is easy to read.  Coffee is and stays hot. About the only negative I can find is the display is gray on gray and hard to read unless you look closely.
Mandi,1.0,"July 3, 2016","I purchased two of these (the second to replace the first)  at Walmart and not from Amazon but I wanted to leave a review to let other people know that I have the same problem of a nasty plastic smell, the eventual decrease in temp and both units  dying within six months of purchase! the pots finished ""beep"" will go off after it makes about 2 cups but even after it says it's finished it'll continue making the coffee--- it just takes about 40 minutes now !!!I thought it was because we have soft water living in the country and using well water and maybe that that the sediment was stopping it up but I see from other reviews that it may be more of a pump defect (i cleaned it several times)....  maybe this will be good for short-term use but there are way more $10 coffee makers that would be more appropriate for that!! Finally gave up and bought a Bunn!! Sadly I will never use another Mr. Coffee coffee maker.  :("
CrysLd,4.0,"October 30, 2012","I really love this coffee maker & the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I haven't had it for too long, yet, so I don't know how long it will last, however, I thoroughly trust the mr. coffee brand, especially because I had another one, from early-mid 2008, & it still works. anyway, I have the red version of this model and it is so nice! I really love the color of the lights when you turn it on...they're so pretty! it doesn't take that long to brew at all (I'd say less than 10 minutes). it also has all the features I wanted in a coffee maker. now, the only things I don't like about it is all the condensation it accumulates on the lid & underneath the removable filter basket & the fact that it drips whenever you remove the carafe but those things would happen with any coffee maker, so it's no big deal & it doesn't really matter, I mean, I bought this, knowing that would happen for sure. also, the condensation under the lid doesn't drip onto your counter or anywhere else (like on the outside of the coffee maker) whenever you open the lid...it just goes back into the filter basket & the water reservoir, so that's another plus. the filter is pretty much useless, though & it doesn't make the coffee taste any better. it just wastes time, taking it out & putting it back in every time I make coffee. the fact that you can use either a thermal or glass carafe is also really nice, especially since it automatically detects which one you're using; I haven't tried that feature, yet but it'll be helpful for company, keeping the coffee hot, while not continuing to cook it. all in all, I'd buy this again."
Edie Carter,3.0,"February 10, 2015","We decided to go back to a regular coffeemaker after using a one cup brewer for a long time. Our old coffeemaker no longer worked so we bought this one. The price was good and I had high expectations based on the claims on the box. I am disappointed. It isn't actually ""programmable"" meaning you cannot set one time for it to come on every day. Instead you must set the ""delay brewer"" option each time you want it to make on its own. Also there are 2 cut outs in the back of the reservoir. My assumption is that these holes are to keep you from overfilling the water. I don't like the holes because dust or other things could easily get in the coffeemaker. I'm going to be putting tape over them. The ""faucet"" that draws the water into the coffee grounds doesn't seem efficient to me. Mr. Coffee makes other coffee brewers with multiple water spouts for a better cup of coffee. The coffee this brewer makes is okay. It is hot. It takes almost a minute per cup brewed from what I can tell. There is a strong plastic smell as it brews. If you just want an inexpensive coffee brewer and you aren't a coffee connoisseur, then you will probably find satisfaction with this model."
George T. Jacoby,4.0,"April 24, 2014","After figuring out how everything goes together (the basket fits only one way; the water filter fits onto the top of the basket but you can orient it 360 deg with one obvious exception), and learning that if the basket is not properly placed it will run over and cause coastal flooding, it works very well and makes a great cup of coffee.  I have read the reviews that slam it for not making a good cup, but I don't see how dripping hot water over coffee grounds leaves much room for variation.  The brew select (Regular or Strong) is on many coffee makers, and just slows the initial dripping to let the grounds steep as it functions.  I use the darkest French Roast I can find, so the stronger the better, but I have also made milder styles for friends and they loved it.  The water filter is for removing chlorine taste/smell only, and I use filtered water already, so I don't worry about replacing it every month or whenever they recommend.  The display is a little dark, but I haven't had a problem reading it in a normally lighted room.  WELL worth the $25 + tax I paid at Wal-Mart ($10 cheaper than Amazon, where I normally shop)."
Goatroper,4.0,"November 11, 2011","I have had a Cuisinart DCC-1200 for the past 4 years and paid about $80.00 for it.  I was very satisfied with its performance up until a couple of years ago when the On/Off toggle switch began malfunctioning.  After brewing was finished it would automatically turn off 5 to 10 minutes later, but should have stayed on for a couple of hours. I continued toggling and was sometimes able to turn it back on to keep the pot of coffee hot, but this seldom worked.  So my second cup would always go into the microwave for reheating.  For some time I have been researching other coffeemakers online and reading the user reviews.  I found that most consumer websites and user reviews still convinced me that the Cuisinart DCC-1200 was the best 8 to 12 cup coffeemaker available.  However, I recently received my Dec. '11 issue of Consumer Reports, which showed the Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT as the ""CR Best Buy"" at only $40.00. I searched the web for user reviews and like what I read. I was pleasantly surprised to immediately find it at Walmart at a Rolled-Back price of only $28.00.  Needless to say, I purchased it and am so VERY satisfied with the Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT that I felt I had to share my opinion with other coffee-lovers.  My ONLY complaint is that, as other users have stated in their reviews, the glass carafe does not pour very well, but if you pour you coffee slowly you will not have coffee spills on the counter top.  I would rate it at 5-stars if the carafe poured as well as my old Cuisinart's did.  Other than that, in my personal opinion, the Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT looks more attractive than the Cuisinart DCC-1200, is not as tall and the clock is larger and easier to see.  I certainly liked the price, too.  Take my advise...forget the paper filters and buy a gold tone permanent re-usable filter basket for about $7.00 from Walmart, too.  It does not necessarily have to be the Mr. Coffee brand.  Just dump out the used grinds after brewing, rinse it off in the sink and put it back into the coffeemaker for the next brew."
Steve Ramm,4.0,"February 24, 2013","I generally review entertainment items on Amazon (DVDS, CDs, books) but this is for my search for a decent coffee maker and how this one held up for me.I loved Mr. Coffee makers for years until my under-the counter one died about 4 years ago. They no longer make it. I've been going through coffee maker after coffee maker trying to find one that makes HOT coffee - recommended brew temp of 185-210. All those I tried rarely got over 165. I called Mr. Coffee aznd asked and they told me about their newest one - not this - that is about $90. But 50% of the reviews said it LEAKED! Then Consumer Reports listed this one and I read reviwews. Again they were mixed. But the coffee maker was under $40. So I gave it a shot. I like the looks of it (though the clock is useless and small and no back light). It is making coffee as hot as 175 - 180 degrees though. Not as hot as I want but I no longer have to put just brewed coffee in microwave as I had to do with Hamilton Beach.  I'm still using the GLASS pot so the second cup is not quite as warm. I'm looking into the thermal carafe to see if that works better.I've had the coffee maker a month now.Doing a LOT of research it seems that NO ONE makes a coffee maker that brews REALLY hot - think Starbucks or even McDonalds - coffee for under $100. We can send a man to the moon but a home coffee maker that brews at recommended temp by the coffee assn.? Not so easy.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic"""
Ms Winston,3.0,"September 19, 2012","I purchased this coffee maker with the insulated carafe as a separate purchase, only to find out that the coffee maker would not brew with the insulated carafe on the hotplate as it is supposed to per the instruction booklet. Believe me, I spent considerable time at the store making sure that I was purchasing the correct insulated carafe for the coffee maker. A call to the Mr Coffee customer service line confirmed I had the correct carafe, but that there was ""something"" wrong with the coffee maker. The coffee maker ""determines"" whether the glass or insulated carafe is being used by the weight on the hot plate. The customer service rep was very nice and helpful, but could only offer me the option of waiting 6-8 weeks for a replacement from Mr Coffee as this model was on back-order. She could not even speculate on what was causing the brew cycle to stop when the insulated carafe was being used, but assured me that it was not a safety issue. After some debate, I decided to keep the coffee maker and use the glass carafe, while keeping the insulated carafe for other uses. After a week, I found that the ""plastic taste"" that some users had reported with this maker had totally disappeared. It does brew a little more slowly than I am used to, but that may be because I like to use the feature that allows me to select a stronger brew. I do not use the programmable feature so I cannot comment upon that aspect of the coffee maker. If the use of the insulated carafe is not an issue for you, I would recommend the coffee maker for your own personal use, but I would not give it as a gift."
Steven Duff,1.0,"September 20, 2019","Be aware that the type of pot in the picture will drip each time you pour a cup of coffee.We have had several of these coffee makers, one quit working and they sent us another one, same dripping problem.  I believe the reason is because of the 'plastic' pouring spout.  We finally gave up the 'mopping' up routine that goes with this pot and purchased another Mr Coffee maker this time with a glass pouring spout.....it hasn't dripped yet.  This is our only complaint about this type coffee maker, its the carafe."
Kalaab M. Pickering,1.0,"June 7, 2013","When I purchased this coffee maker, I thought it was the total package: brew strength controls, timer, good looks, and inexpensive.  Unfortunately, I had it for only a few months before it failed.  I've used it every day for about 5 months, and now the strong brew mode doesn't even work (the machine makes three beeps and switches to normal), and now the machine takes over two hours to brew 12 cups.  I don't know exactly how long it takes to brew 12 cups now because the machine has an auto-shutoff feature that stops the brewing process after two hours, and by that time I only have 6 to 7 anemic cups in the carafe.  I suspect that the pumping mechanism is jammed in some way, but every effort to clear the path has been unsuccessful.I bought this machine because it was a brand I had heard of.  Mr. Coffee is synonymous with drip-brew coffee makers.  When this machine failed, I replaced it with an old-school percolator.  We'll see how long that lasts, but there are far fewer components to the percolator.  Not as many bells and whistles, but its beauty is in its simplicity.  Five months is a pretty short run for a coffee maker.  The only benefit is that I didn't pay much for it, but that's the last I'll spend on Mr. Coffee."
Jp,2.0,"March 26, 2016","My husband and I purchased this pot about a week before Thanksgiving, 2015, replacing an elderly pot that we knew was failing. I LOVED this coffee pot - it brewed fast, made great coffee, and was programmable so we could get up to hot coffee all ready and waiting each morning. Until today. No coffee. The lights come on, but nothing happens. RIP for a four month old coffee pot. I expect longer service than that, and reading the other reviews on here this is a very common problem. Coffee pot sat on same counter, was expected to make one pot a day, and was kept clean and fed filtered water. We typically have pots last us for years, so disappointed that this died in less than 6 months. Will not be replacing with another Mr Coffee."

my girls' mom,1.0,"December 27, 2012","Rarely do I give anything 1-star and this probably deserves more for the simple reason it works. I've had this maker for about a year.**UPDATE** Yes this coffee maker worked. But not for long -- at least not as long as one would think. I can confidently say that it brewed right around 400 pots of coffee. I went to the cupboard, got out my husband's grandmother's 1950's Westinghouse percolator that had been out of use since purchasing the Mr. Coffee and it was still going strong. It's probably brewed 100x the number of pots and has only had the cord replaced in its long life. Never again Mr. Coffee.The ""perks"" so to speak: It looks nice. (I have the red one.)The cons:No matter how carefully you pour, the carafe drips and causes a mess.The 'filter' is unhandy and just adds to the cost of your cup of coffee.The reservoir ventilation is awful! No matter how many times it's cleaned with vinegar a strong musty/moldy smell develops within a day or two.I don't recommend this one."
Micah Sampson,1.0,"November 23, 2015","PLEASE READ.... I WISH I HAD KNOWN:I wanted so much to love this coffee maker! It seamed to have everything that I wanted... BUT there were 3 major things that got in the way. I liked it so much that I was willing to over look the glaring shortfalls if it was only just maybe 1 of them, but all 3 together, I couldn't ignore ALL 3!1. IT'S LIKE A FREAKING RAIN FOREST IT THERE...! Unfortunately this creates A LOT of steam that gets trapped in the top, so much so that when you open it, it runs out EVERY WHERE , and onto your counter. Being health conscious EVERY DAY you need to First POOR out as much of the left over trapped water as you can, AND YOU STILL WILL HAVE TO leave it open ALL DAY just to dry it out, OR BETTER YET LEAVE IT UPSIDEDOWN FOR THE ENTIRE DAY (witch is stupid, to have an upsidedown coffee maker sitting on your counter everyday?!?) just so it doesn't create tons of mold and eventually kill you when you drink your coffee. (Truthfully you actually can't even dry it out, there is that much water trapped all over the inside). You need to do some serious cleaning/drying routine every morning. And no one has THAT kinda time, it's really bad...2. NO WARMING PLATE MODE to keep coffee hot after it automatically turns off!!!(Unfortunately I do love this feature in my coffee makers, and I failed to notice this one did not have it when I purchased it. (My bad).3. The cool ""Chrome"" panel has a disappointing plastic look & feel to it. It's NOT metal. Unfortunately, because the design is cool, so this makes it look and feel cheap.BUT THE WATER RAIN FORREST INSIDE THAT GETS EVERYWHERE IS THE FINAL AND MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM TO BE SURE. And no, it is not a damaged or malfunction, it simply traps in all the evaporating water and it cant get out. Design fail. I'm sorry, I'm taking mine back as soon as I get home. I tired for a week to make it work out for us, but I know there are better coffee makers out there."
Kelly Ohl,1.0,"December 28, 2013","So I moved here to Georgia from Ohio and my old coffee pot broke in the move. I ran out and bought this to replace my old one.I open the box and the decanter is broke in 3 pieces. Not a big problem, I run out and buy a replacement at Walmart and I make the first pot of coffee and it goes fine.The second and third pots leak all over the counter, and my counter is now flooded with water and coffee grounds. I STILL continue to hold out hope for this thing.It worked about half the time, the other half it leaked, and finally after 6 months of using it, it just refuses to turn on. The clock works, it's getting power, but the button to turn on the actual coffee maker to start brewing no longer works. After resisting the temptation to go all Office Space on it and beat it with a baseball bat, I just threw it out and bought a new one. How this thing has any positive reviews astound me."
N. Zeravla,3.0,"July 9, 2014","It's fine, and the price is right, but the accessory thermal carafe we bought is a bit clumsy and disappointing. The braun we had formerly held more than 8 cups and didn't require screwing and unscrewing motions--it was an easy push-button. This one requires you to unscrew the top just the right amount or it either won't dispense if it's too tight, or it will spill all over if it's too loose. Also it doesn't keep liquid hot as long as the braun did.Another thing: there was a pretty pungent and aversive plastic chemical smell in the machine which we tried to get rid of by doing water and/or vinegar solution passes. It did not help even after a dozen such passes. And I did not feel comfortable drinking coffee from this machine until the smell dissipated, which took about a week. Now it's ok, but I don't recall this kind of a smell in previous machines I have bought.Other than that it works and I'm basically happy with it."
Suzanne,1.0,"December 22, 2014","I purchased this from another source.The instructions say turn on the select button ""the strong brew strength amber light will turn on"" when pressed. ""The coffee maker will retain the brew strength you have selected until you change it"". This is totally inaccurate. The brew strength always stays on regular. Even when I change the coffee brew to strong each time it brews a weak and awful tasting cup of coffee. I am using the same high quality beans I used with my last Mr Coffee until it broke.The coffee this brews is what my friends and I refer to as ""Hotel Coffee"" weak and terrible"". It is amazing how this coffee pot can take a high quality coffee and turn it to nasty in less than 10 minutes."
J. Hansell,2.0,"August 18, 2014","The last thing I want when I""m groggily making breakfast and waiting for my first cup of coffee is to hear loud piercing beeps, but that's what this coffeemaker does - 3 beeps when the cycle is through. As far as I can tell so far, you can't disable this ""feature.""  The coffee is OK, and I like the design - it's easier to pour without dripping than my last machine.  Another unfortunate feature: both I and my husband are left=handed, and the door to the water compartment opens to the left. THis meant to make it very easy to pour water in from the right, but blocks access from the left. It's still a lot better than our last one, which had a tiny opening for water - I spilled constantly. But if you're manual-dexterity challenged and a leftie, don't buy this machine. If I can find the receipt, I'll probably return this because of the beeps."
Gene,5.0,"November 11, 2010","Purchased this coffee maker at local retailer after trying but returning a KitchenAid with thermal carafe.  The Mr Coffee is 1/2 the price and twice the function.  The optional thermal carafe can be substituted for the glass carafe and the machine automatically detects the carafe and adjusts by turning the hot plate on (glass) or off (thermal.  Has all the functions of the best coffee makers.  Makes great coffee at a temperature that is hot enough to make the coffee taste good without being so hot that it burns the coffee.  I have had some issues with Mr Coffee designs in other older machines but this machine seems to be well designed.  As an example, the water spout that delivers hot water to the coffee grounds is automatically placed over the coffee when the cover is closed.  (You must move the spout to remove the coffee grounds basket and this feature ensures that it is always placed back at the proper location.  The option of glass for 12 cups or thermal for 8 cups of coffee allows great flexibility.  I highly recommend this coffee maker."
Michelle,2.0,"January 12, 2014","Okay so it looks nice but some points to consider:We like a good hot, strong cup of cofffee and the temperature when first brewed was 175 degrees and after sitting on the hot plate it fell to 172 degrees.  Not bad if only the unit would have lasted as ours stopped working after 2 weeks.The water viewing window is located on the right hand side and the reseviour is located in the back.  We are right handed so it was difficult to see the water line if we filled from the Brita as we have always done.  Instead, we had to fill the pot to the amout of cups we wanted and then pour that into the maker.  Not to much of a hassle, but an extra step nonetheless.  Top that off with the fact the lines on the pot do not match from one side to the other so if you don't want a full pot, use the same side as a gauge all the time.One more thing to know - the instructions tell you if you want the strong brew, you must hit the strong brew button (this is accurate) and it also states it will remember this function unless the unit is unplugged or until you turn off this function.  Not true, you must tell it to brew on the strong cycle with every new pot of coffee.I was secretly glad this unit bit the dust so quickly as I dreaded having to work with it for the next year."
ChiBoi,4.0,"December 22, 2011","So far, so good with this coffee maker. I had to replace the Cuisinart that I bought last year because no matter how good the beans were, the coffee tasted lousy and would get cold in a matter of moments after brewing. Like many of you, I was reticent about purchasing a Mr. Coffee coffeemaker. The brand is known for being synonymous with cheap, but after reading multiple reviews on line and seeing it as a Best Buy on Consumer Reports, I decided that for the price, it would be worth a shot.So far I'm really pleased with my choice. It has a simple, yet aesthetic design that I find very pleasing. It's fairly easy to set up and clean up is painless.Two of the best features of this unit are the Delay Brew and Coffee Strength options. I used fresh French Roast beans from a locally acclaimed micro roaster. The first evening, I set the delay brew for 9:05am and I set the brew strength to strong. I didn't get to the coffee until close to 9:30am. The coffee was hot and delectable. It was a nice strong brew with little to no after taste. This unit also has a freshness timer. I was able to see that my coffee had been waiting for me for :25. I know from experience that if the coffee has been brewed and sitting for more than 35 minutes, that the freshness begins to degrade quickly. The Cuisinart's delay brew function was difficult to set up, it didn't always start on time, and the warming plate would cut off as soon as brewing was done. If I allowed the coffee to sit for more than 5 minutes (in a thermal carafe nonetheless), it would be cold and foul tasting.The next evening, I set up the delay brew for the same time of morning, but this time, I set it up for regular brew strength. Once again, my coffee was nice and hot 20 minutes later. The taste was okay. I got more of the fresh plastic taste in this cup than I did previously. I'm sure in time that will wear off. In the meantime, I'll be using the strong brew option.The only complaint I have about this unit is the finish, or lack thereof (thus the four stars instead of 5). There were errant pieces of plastic inside the water reservoir and sticking out of the vent holes. Though I ran it through with water the first time, I did not get all of the pieces out apparently. After I brewed the first pot of coffee, I found more plastic pieces on top of the filtration system. If I didn't have the filtration system in place, then the pieces would have ended up in my grounds. This would have been a very different review if that had been the case. I used some needle nose pliers and a nail file to remove the plastic shards that were sticking out and smooth it down more.The second pot had more of the smell but not the shards. Hopefully the third pot will be the charm.Overall, though, this is a great buy. My Cusinart cost twice as much but never worked half as well. I highly recommend it."
M,5.0,"October 19, 2015","Brews a decent cup of coffee, I used to have a GE and it brewed a lot weaker flavor. Also has a strong mode which takes slightly longer but really makes a strong almost espresso like coffee. My GE used to stink like plastic too, this one does not have that smell (though I saw some other reviewers claim theirs did). The buttons are metal too instead of plastic like many digital machines that starts to bubble up and look bad after a months so it will hopefully look nice for a long time. The only thing I don't like about it is the pouring, it drips a lot when you pour it getting coffee on the counter. Also the water hole for the reservoir is kind of small and its easy to get a little messy with the pouring."
westwardster,1.0,"December 23, 2013","We needed to replace an older model from Mr Coffee that had lasted so long that it was beyond proper cleaning.  We chose this model based on its features, price and our own experience with the brand.  We did not buy it from Amazon.The machine performed admirably right out of the box.  All of the features worked.  There were no odors, no spillage issues - just good coffee.Then about two weeks ago, we brewed a full pot and were getting ready to pour our second cups when the coffee in the pot suddenly began to boil!  Needless to say we shut it off and let the liquid cool before drinking it.This was a first for us and we didn't realize that it had self-destructed until the next time we tried to use it.  Bye, bye Mr Coffee...Any appliance that quits on you inside of four months is a bad appliance."
Amh,5.0,"November 8, 2011","Second day in to our coffee maker and we've already made four pots of coffee. Each time, a breeze, and good tasting coffee too. The delay feature is fantastic, and i love the alert beeps. I heard it this morning waking up and was pleased to know it functioned exactly as it was supposed to. I have it set for when my boyfriend comes home from work tonight. The instructions are clear and easy to understand. I drink fancy coffeeshop coffee as well as our home made stuff, and your water quality really does matter, as well as filtration! KEEP UP WITH THAT FILTER! It makes a huge difference in taste if you have city water. We are using a basket versus filters, i think they really help keep the unit SO much cleaner, and for four dollars, you honestly cannot beat it. Buy two, in case sometime down the line you break one, and really, if youre careful with your stuff you WONT need to buy another one for a good long time. Makes a huge difference i feel, ill never go back to paper filters again! The added disc filter is a neat feature, ive never had a maker that had one, simple to use, fits right into the grounds basket to boot, no issues whatsoever. I like that you set the red tab on the water filter to what month you put it in. That helps! I do wish the hot plate just remained on, if you wanted it to. As we usually make a large batch of coffee and drink it all day, two hours on time is really plenty though overall, and you can just turn the unit BACK on if you really want more time.I love it. I say go buy one, especially if youre used to the 20.00 ones with no features and looking for an upgrade, Its really nicely built, and is worth the money, I dont need anything fancier, simple and to the point. Coffee is plenty hot, and i did the cleaning process only once, and didnt notice any plastic taste.OH! fantastic feature to mention, that i bet not many notice, is when you lift the lid to pour in water, the condensation dosnt get EVERYWHERE! Its built right into the lid so that it pours back down into the unit and into a channel to the reservoir. Totally fantastic touch. I cant tell you how many coffeemakers ive had that would get water all over the counter, after the fact, because of the lid for the grounds and the reservoir, and there was no design thought put into channeling that water back into the machine! Love it!!!!! I think i am in love with it for that reason more than i am the programming features, i cant tell you how badly that would bug me in other machines."
S. Wilson,5.0,"August 17, 2015","We don't have words for how much we love our coffee pot. It gets used every day, sometimes 2-3 times a day. The fact that it has a strong brew option is amazing. We love our coffee very strong and this pot delivers without us having to use extra grounds. The water filter ensures that our coffee always tastes smooth and fresh because we have especially hard water, but we don't have to use a special water filtration system (like a Brita pitcher) to get the best flavor of coffee possible - just pop in a water filter! They're easy to change and affordable, too. Some of our other favorite features include the timer and the drip pause. Over all, this is a stellar coffee pot and an excellent investment for java lovers!"

David Lawliet,1.0,"January 6, 2016","I bought this machine toward the end of 2015 and here we are in the first week of 2016 and it's already broken. I woke this morning to find less than five of my 20 ounces had been made by the automated timer. The hot plate doesn't work and the machine will not do anything with the water in the compartment. Cleaned it well, reset the machine.. Nothing. The only thing that works on it now are the indicator lights. For $40 I feel very ripped off. Will not be purchasing another product from this company. And from what I'm seeing on other reviews this seems to be a fairly common occurence. Very disappointing experience."
Grumpy Goat,3.0,"February 18, 2012","Great coffee maker. No bad taste issues. Works as expected and makes coffee nice and hot. The downside - the carafe can only be described in language I cannot post here.Pouring from the carafe at any rate other than a dead trickle results in a steady dribble down the side of the carafe and on to the counter. Filling the reservoir or a coffee mug involves follow up with a rag, so any time saved by its conveniences is offset by this useless step of wiping up the mess. I just poured my second cup this morning and immediately felt compelled to share this review. The designers could easily have sorted this out by proper testing and they would have realised that the spot was too shallow to pour without spilling.So if you don't mind the extra step then get this otherwise great maker. Minus 2 stars for the carafe spout!"
Sonja,1.0,"June 1, 2015","The spigot does not extend far enough over the coffee basket, so that the water flowing out INVARIABLY causes the filter paper to fold over, so that grounds get into the pot and the coffee is weak.  Almost every single morning this happens, and it makes me mad!  I am about to go spend money on another coffee maker, even though this one is still fairly new.  At the price of coffee these days, that makes more sense than to keep throwing out coffee that is undrinkable.  I will be buying any other brand BUT Mr. Coffee this time."
KSB,4.0,"January 26, 2015","I bought this coffee maker in January 2015 because Consumer Reports gave it a ""best buy"" rating. At first I was very pleased with it.I've had none of the problems other reviewers have mentioned. I like the ""delay"" setting where I can set it to come on while I'm still in bed. The smell of fresh brewed coffee gives me an incentive to get up! However I've noticed lately that even when I use twice as much coffee grounds as I used to, the coffee comes out weak an flavorless. I even put it on the ""stronger"" setting. Do you need to clean this with vinegar every two weeks? What a pain! Don't know what the solution is because it gave me excellent coffee when I first bought it."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"January 28, 2020","This coffee pot is absolutely horrible. I just bought it and the clock jumps ahead HOURS every single time completely screwing up my morning routine, for example I set the CLOCK for 8:00 PM and I will look at it several minutes later and it reads 11:39 PM for example. Then when I proceeded to speak with customer service they had me going back and forth in at least 5 or 6 emails just to tell me to send it to them so they can ""investigate the unit"" ! Which would cost money and would not even send a new one after sending several codes on my coffee maker and photos. UNREAL . Do not bother! Go with another company plain and simple!"
TC,5.0,"December 11, 2017","I've had this coffee maker for a few years now, it is used every day, sometimes twice a day and I've always been more than pleased with this, Especially love the Delay brew option. I can prepare everything the night before, set the delay and wake up to the smell of fresh brewed coffee. My mother-in-law has this in red and loves hers as well. I highly recommend this one, especially for the price."
Kindle Customer,5.0,"December 29, 2014","The chlorine filter was a surprise! The pot has a slightly better than average pouring spout, so there are fewer dribbles. The chrome and black finish looks nice in my kitchen. The coffeemaker brews quietly and efficiently. There is a beeper when the pot is done brewing as well as one when the timer is turning the heating unit off.This coffeemaker comes with an optional thermal carafe. I will probably order that later. I was in a rush as my previous coffeemaker was starting to leak and I needed to replace it right away.The only negative is that the water guide is so far back on the side that it is difficult to read while filling the pot with water."
Mal D,2.0,"January 15, 2014","My wife got me this as a gift for Christmas, since I've been wanting a programable automatic coffeemaker to help me get going faster in the mornings. She looked for a long time and read a lot of reviews, and the only reason she ultimately picked this one was it was the only one that had a ""battery back-up feature"" (our power goes out often).What a disappointment. My biggest complaint is how lukewarm the coffee is. I can pull the thermal pot out the second it's done brewing, pour a 12-oz cup, and if I wanted to, down the whole thing in 5 seconds like it was tap water. That's not what coffee is supposed to be like. I have to microwave my coffee right after it's been brewed??? Are you kidding me?As for the ""keeps your coffee warm for two hours"" - I see no evidence of that, unless room temperature counts as ""warm.""My other quibbles are there's no light for the digital display, so it can be very difficult to read the time setting; I have to occasionally use a small flashlight or tilt the maker into the direct path of an overhead light. My strong brew button also doesn't work - using either the regular or thermal carafes. It always kicks back over to the normal setting.Oh - and this supposed backup battery thing. Doesn't exist (on this unit) as far as I can tell. Oh the irony.It's 2014. Coffee is probably the most consumed drink on the planet after straight water. I would have thought the technology would be a little more robust by now, especially from a company called ""Mr. Coffee."" If you like your coffee lukewarm, then this unit should work fine for you; but if you prefer your coffee hot, you're going to need a microwave too."
JW,1.0,"January 10, 2016","I don't know why this coffee maker gets such good reviews. I purchased mine based what I read. I bought mine in September and it was dead the first week of January. The heating element quit, the warmer quit and it no longer moved the water. A real waste of money. This ended up being worse quality than you used to get out of a cheap no frills Mr. Coffee maker. It made the same quality of coffee as a cheap model too, even with quality beans. The warmer kept the coffee too hot, and would stew it instead. I really don't recommend this coffee maker!"
Happy nose,1.0,"January 27, 2014","Got it out of the box, looked for instructions...none. No biggie,wasn't that difficult to figure out. Set it up, ground some coffee,  brewed it up on strong. Poured a cup, brought it up to my lips, took a sip. Turned and spit it right into the sink. Haven't  drunk anything that foul since a roommate put curdled cream in my Sanka.OK, not one to give up so easily, I ran a couple of pots of water through the coffee maker to rinse the plasticky taste away. Still there. Tried white vinegar. No better. Tried lemon juice. Still awful. Went looking online to see if anyone had the same problem. It appears that they had, in great numbers. One site said the best cure was to rinse it with vodka. I don't know whether it worked for them, or they just didn't care after that, but it didn't work for me.Returned it, gonna try the Black & Decker."
Lsura,1.0,"September 25, 2015","Terrible coffee maker. Oh, I suppose it makes ok coffee, though nothing wonderful. I didn't expect much better from a $30 machine. But now, approximately 60 days after purchase (long enough that I don't have the receipt or the packaging*), the hot plate on the bottom has loosened and sagged, so the coffee maker no longer presses up against the filter basket, with 2 consequences. 1) coffee everywhere and 2) grounds all in my coffee.So, I guess I'm shopping for coffee makers this weekend. Mr. Coffee products won't be on that list at all.*I purchased at a brick & mortar retailer, not Amazon"
Sailing away,2.0,"January 30, 2017","IF THIS STILL WORKED, I would give it 4 stars, because I had no problem with smell or other complaints, and it USED TO brew good-tasting hot coffee quickly and quietly.  Water gauge very inconvenient but thermal carafe made up for it in our 2-pot family.  But it lasted only 13 months, and while that is longer than for some who have reviewed here, it's not long enough to earn more than 2 stars, even if we do make 2 pots a day.  Your mileage may vary, so if durability is not a concern this is a nice coffeemaker."
Lando,1.0,"April 28, 2015","Do not buy Mr. Coffee brand coffee makers.  I've had FOUR of them go bad now in the past few years and NONE of them lasted more than two years.  The espresso maker lasted less than ONE WEEK.  Now my mother's Mr. Coffee maker just died the same death mine did.  After researching, it appears the thermal fuses blow internally for some reason (cheap heater element overheating?) and that's all she wrote unless you want to drill through their torx lock screw (there to prevent you from fixing it yourself for a buck since they figure you will just go buy another ""cheap"" maker every 6 months).  I had a Mr. Coffee back in the early '80s and the thing was a TANK.  It lasted over 20 years.  It was all manual controls (you turned the brewer on/off and had to keep an eye on it since you turned the brewer off with a switch), but it never had any problems during that time.  Now they're all made in foreign countries out of cheap parts and plastic junk.  I'm not sure what brand to get next, but Mr. Coffee has proven to me they don't DESERVE my business for making such cheap junk.  I haven't bothered to replace mine since I have an excellent Bonjour French Press and an electric Presto percolator, both of which produce better tasting coffee than a drip maker due to the more ideal 200 degree range temperatures they use to brew (percolator maintains and the French Press is more of a physics boiling water quickly drops to about 200 in a few seconds).  I had Krups espresso maker go bad shortly after its warranty was up as well (handle came loose and wouldn't tighten).  I've had better luck with my Cuisinart espresso maker (good for 3+ years now), but my Cuisinart grinder died after 6 years an I tried another brand and the hopper got stuck and cracked on the first use.  I'd take 6 years use over 6 minutes.  I think it's time some companies started making QUALITY kitchen appliances again.  I'm done with Mr. Coffee for good."

Never realized the carafe's were so irregular.  100% positive this one will fail within a month or so...off to another manufacturer and see if I can get a dependable coffee maker.  They had their chance."
Brenda Miller,4.0,"December 3, 2014","A really great coffee maker, easy to use if you've had coffee makers before, directions for programming would be confusing if you have never had one. Don't expect to be able to use the clock as a kitchen clock unless the coffee maker is at or above eye level and its not lit so you can not see it in the dark.  The cord is short measuring 23 inches, and the fill lid opens from the top, so keep that in mind if you plan to keep it on a counter top that is under cabinets because you will have to pull it out to fill. It makes great coffee and looks nice too. I would give it 5 stars if the clock was illuminated and the cord was a little longer."
Brenda,1.0,"May 4, 2013","This coffeemaker looks attractive.  That is about the only good thing I can tell you.  The coffee tastes awful.  I had a cheaper brand of Mr. Coffee that did better than this one.  The filtration system of getting the water into the coffee sucks.  I have never bought a coffeemaker that takes so long to make coffee.  I'm talking about 2 hours.  My mother just bought this one and then she fell and broke her hip.  We have used this less than 6 weeks and it just has some internal defects.  I have cleaned it out with vinegar, then went to bleach water, then put salt to soften the water and remove any lime in the water.  Trust me, nothing works.  It is a crappy coffeemaker.  They need to recall it.  Worthless."
J4,1.0,"August 14, 2015","I purchased a Mr. Coffee like this (model bvmc-tjxe7) a couple months back from a local retailer. NEVER again.1. Burns every pot off coffee, the heating plate is just too hot, extremely too hot.2. The carafe is an absolute design disaster. It leaks coffee everywhere with every pour. Did anyone test this before they took it to market? Impossible. I've tried pouring from every angle at every speed and without fail I'm wiping up spills. Worse yet, the coffee is now leaking BACKWARDS from the handle! How does this happen you say? Well, in another genius design decision, there is a plastic rim that sits above, inside and around the top of the carafe, and there is a section cut out (yes -  intentionally) where the handle joins, creating a gap for coffee to gather so that when you set the pot upright the coffee literally pours backwards onto the counter from the bottom of handle.. sigh.3.  Related to number 2. - as if all that wasn't bad enough, the shape of the opening is custom so a standard replacement carafe can't fit inside. So forget you, consumer, you have to use our cruddy, terrible carafe no matter what.Somewhere no doubt, a disgruntled design lead sits in his cubicle, probably twirling the tips of a handle bar mustache, reading this review with satisfaction as he fondly remembers the many hours spent forging successful test results leading up to this machine being manufactured.Complete WASTE OF MONEY."
RMcQuade,1.0,"April 5, 2013","My husband purchased this coffeepot at a local store so we wouldn't wear out the Kuerig. We have a My Kcup, but as much coffee as we drink it seemed a good idea to make one pot of coffee a day and reserve the Kuerig for our favorite flavored coffees or other specialty drinks. Our other 'back up' coffee maker was an older model Mr. Coffee.First of all the clock had so much condensation inside after one use we couldn't read it. Setting the timer involved standing in strategic positions to guess what the clock readout was. It cleared up only once. We keep it pulled out on the counter as per one other user's advice so steam could escape - no dice.Second - No matter how you fill the filter grounds escape. We don't over-fill it, so I don't get it.Third - Today (4/5/2013) the unit just stopped working. It won't turn on at all. 3 weeks and it wasn't even used every day after the first week.Don't waste your money. I'm sad to say that since our other Mr. Coffee coffeemaker was over 15 years old and performed well. We only replaced it because of a broken carafe."
Lady At The Lake,3.0,"June 9, 2013","Husband brought this home in the red color, which was just too bright and contrasty for my taste in the kitchen.He returned it for the ""chrome,"" one which is a tad bid less flashy, but still more ""chrome"" than I like. It takes up more room on the counter top as compared to the other Mr. Coffee which died this morning.  It makes coffee just like the other one, no issues thus far - pretty basic.Next time, I'd like one that has a little smaller of a footprint and I don't need the flashy silver plastic look they call chrome.Why can't these things last longer than a year?"
SugarBeachHippie,1.0,"October 8, 2014",We bought this even though we end up disapointed everytime we try Mr. Coffee pots.  But we thought since this was a little nicer one and we were on a budget we would try it.  It looks nice and fancy and has some nice settings but it still dribbles when you pour like mr coffee always does and 4 months after we bought it it just decided to stop working one morning.  It would turn on but wouldn't heat up or brew!!  What a waste of money. So we are done with mr coffee!  Cuisinart or Hamilton Beach for us!  We tried again and ended up especially dissapointed this time around…. Excuse me while I order a better coffee maker ;)
Mark Vassmer,3.0,"December 21, 2011","Purchased to replace an old Braun coffee maker that had a broken carafe. Had the features we liked, autostop, water filter, delayed start, and the option of a permanent, rather than, paper filter.  Also had two brew strengths, a timer showing the age of the brew, and settings for an optional  thermal carafe.  Was able to follow instructions, though diagrams and text were a little hard to follow.  Filter and basket parts only fit in one way.  Rinsed it per directions and brewed a great tasting cup of coffee.  No dripping from carafe when pouring,  no off odors in coffee, though the machine did have the new smell when first opened before the rinsing.  I would recommend this as an excellent value, even after using it less than a month so far.  They were out I'd stock on Amazon, but Walmart had them.1-Year Update - The ""AUTOSTOP"" spring and plug on the plastic part that holds the filter broke off in the dishwasher 2 times! I replaced the part the first time.  Coffee also DOES DRIP badly on the counter when pouring from the carafe if you don't lift the lid while pouring."
SewNovice,1.0,"December 14, 2011","I purchase this machine about two months ago. I purchased this because I drink a lot of coffee (at least a pot a day) and K cups for my Keurig add up! So I like to alternate between using the Keurig and brewing regular coffee. Initially, it worked fine. I like the option of brewing a ""strong cup"", the timer function, and auto shutoff. However, after about a month of regular use, I would awaken to find my countertop covered in coffee. It appears the spring at the bottom of the filter basket housing gets compressed over time. This resulted in the carafe not pushing the plug upwards which allows the coffee to flow into the pot. The end result is that the coffee fills the basket until there's nowhere left to go but over the top. Since I typically like to have coffee brewed by the time I'm out of bed, there's no way to catch this disaster. In addition, I tried stretching the spring which appears to work for one brew and then it's back to the same problem. I bought the coffeemaker, thinking it was a great bargain (I own two Keurigs and it was much cheaper), however it is not worth the aggravation. I suppose one could find a stronger spring or stretch the one there every time they wanted to use the coffeemaker but I don't want to have to tweak I product which is supposed to work as intended. This was a horrible purchase which will end up in the trash. BTW, the carafe spills every time I pour from it and the hinged lid is flimsy. If you are a regular coffee drinker like I am, save your money and invest in a worthy machine."
typingrandma,1.0,"July 12, 2016",It was awesome for a year and a half!  Then it started leaking water out of the bottom of the reservoir all over my counter!  I think a top end coffeepot should last more than a year and a half with only half time use.  I am very disappointed.  My very first coffeepot from Mr. Coffee years ago leaked out the bottom as well.  Next coffee pot I purchase I will go to another name brand.  I called a small appliance store and they said that means the pump had gone out!!!  WOW!!
AJ,2.0,"October 17, 2014","While this got such good reviews both on Amazon and Consumer Reports.....I don't get it.  The maker overflows constantly.  This is because of design - the grounds holder, which also has the plunger that the carafe pushes up on to release the coffee into the carafe - is floating (not held down).  Therefore about 1/2 the time when you put the carafe under, instead of the plunger valve being pushed up, and coffee flowing, the whole grounds holder pushes up, the valve never opens, and 10 minutes later you have a staining coffee mess on your counter.  I'm a mechanical engineer, and it is clear that this is a poor design to avoid spills.  Amazon did take the unit back as a return, so I am happy with their service."
HeadyTopper,1.0,"December 10, 2012","The user has to do too much to get this thing to work.  I've used coffee makers for 25 years and never had these problems.1.  The water reservoir is in the same compartment as the grounds.  If the grounds overflow they go straight into the reservoir, get sucked up into the mechanism and plug it up, shutting it down.  It takes f.o.r.e.v.e.r to clean it out.2.  If you don't line up the plastic basket correctly, and there are a couple of positions that feel like it's in correctly, the grounds will overflow into the water chamber because the spring-loaded plug at the bottom of it is not lifted properly by the carafe.3.  You must swing the water spout away from the basket to change the grounds.  If you don't swing the water spout back over the grounds it will spit the coffee back into the water reservoir.  If you move the coffee maker much, like in a motorhome or outside for a picnic, the water spout can swing on its own and be in the wrong position.4.  If you aren't exactly perfect with pouring water into the chamber behind the grounds basket, the water goes into the basket and all over other surfaces, splashing out.5.  If the carafe is not placed exactly correctly, the plug at the bottom of the basket won't open, and it will overflow backwards into the water reservoir.  So if you grab an old carafe from a previous maker by mistake, it's not just all over the counter, it's inside where it's a real mess.6.  So far it takes two filters at a time to keep them from collapsing in on the grounds, also creating grounds in the coffee.7.  The chrome on the front of this looks cheap, and I don't have much hope that it will stay in one piece.I'm not lazy, and I'm not even out of it in the morning until I get my coffee, but I was distracted once with company, and one of the things that needed to be done, wasn't, and the grounds went everywhere, and there was only half the coffee in the pot.  It was undrinkable and it smelled like the grounds that spilled into the water reservoir were burning and smoking.  How many years has this company been designing coffee makers?"
D. Albright,1.0,"August 5, 2016","This unit must be designed to fail!  They tell us that budget coffee makers are only supposed to last one or two years.  This must have been written by a twenty something used to nothing but Chinese junk!  I have been around a while and remember when Mr. Coffee ""budget"" coffeemakers lasted MANY YEARS.  When it quits they will send you a new one....right!....the same model that has failed for everyone who bought one.  Customer Service....handled by a separate entity that represents many companies and issues the same stock apologies for everything and could care less!"
Alex Scorpio,2.0,"March 31, 2015","It's next to impossible to find a good coffeemaker at a reasonable price, so I bought this based on the favorable reviews posted here. The big problem is that the machine is designed so that the arm that drips the water into the filter is not centered over the filter basket. No matter how much coffee I make, some of the the ground coffee is dry when the brew cycle is done. As a result, the coffee is weak unless you compensate by putting in more coffee. You end up wasting a lot of coffee and time."
zorg,1.0,"May 26, 2015","Yet another product built to last just beyond the warranty date, forcing you to keep buying these things once a year or so.We bought this 15 months ago on Amazon (on my wife's account).Today the coffee pot/carafe shattered when exposed to hot water when hand washing it.  2 months ago the reusable filter's handle broke.The feature meant to ""pause"" dripping while you pour you coffee doesn't always work and it drips water/coffee onto the burner."
TheDucks,3.0,"July 17, 2014","It makes Good Coffee but I hate the Glass Carafe spout.Initial setup (prep) was easy. Remove packaging, wash the Carafe and basket, brew a Pot of water.I do question the recommended  quantity of grounds: 9Tablespoons for 12 cups would overflow the filter.Did the writers make the common confusion of tsp (teaspoon)<=> tbsp (tablespoon)I used 4.5 Tbsp and the basket was 2/3 filled after brewingThe carafe spout? The short neck makes it impossible to pour without dribbles"
Kansailor,4.0,"November 26, 2011","Have had this pot for over a year now.  I like the timer feature--shuts off after 2 hours. Makes good coffee, doesn't burn coffee.  No problem filing water reservoir,  filter collapsed on me one time but I think that was because the filter was folded to begin with.  Carafe doesn't leak if you don't pour too quickly--just like most other coffeemakers i've ever owned and way better than some I've owned.  I have the thermal carafe but don't use it.Only complaint I have is that the heating plate under the coffee carafe is rusting.  I clean the pot after each morning's use but don't dry it.  There is condensation on the pot sometimes--all normal usage issues. Once the paint wears off the plate, it starts to rust.  I wish the plate came in stainless steel or that I could buy a stainless replacement.5 stars for great coffee maker but one star off for rusting plate"
Tony P.,2.0,"June 3, 2012","I believed the hype from CU regarding this highly-rated product.  I should have read more reviews from actual users.I bought it at a B&M store two months ago and am returning it today.  My wife noticed that we could not get the coffee and maker to stop smelling like plastic.  Yes, we cleaned it.  Also, the optional thermal carafe is not worth purchasing even if you like the coffee maker; it made the coffee smell and taste ""off"" as well.One thing in particular I don't understand re: the product design is the lack of steam vents; the water heating area consistently had cooled steam condensed in the water storage area.  This simply seems like a bad idea (moisture breeds bacteria, etc.).Very disappointing."
David Swanick,1.0,"December 29, 2013","After years of faithful service from my previous Mr. Coffee machine, it finally went to caffeine heaven and I was forced to replace it.  So I had no qualms about getting its new, redesigned progeny.First, the minor faults.Yes, there was the mentioned ""plastic taste"" for the first several uses.  But it seemed to dissipate for me after about a week of regular use.  And yes, there was the general lack of rich flavor which wasn't completely alleviated by brewing on ""strong"".  Which brings me to the another problem - that you have to set a ""strong"" brew every time you start a regular or delayed brew cycle.  My previous Mr.C didn't need this, it's just a failure of the design.  Finally, there is the carafe, which will dribble and splash if you try and pour at any pace faster than ""dead slow"".But those are minor issues.  After a few weeks of use I started a brew cycle only to have half of the water back up in the ground basket and run everywhere, even into the fresh water reservoir.  Coffee was running down the inside of the carafe area and onto the hot plate, and even after repeated rinsings I am unable to get all of the grounds out of the fresh water reservoir.In short, while previous versions of the Mr. Coffee have been great products, this one is not."
K to the eadie,1.0,"July 1, 2015","I don't understand WHY there are SO MANY great reviews here. I had to buy a coffeemaker RIGHT AWAY, after mine died one night. It was more than 8 yrs. old, and was my most reliable friend. It, too, was a Mr. Coffee, which was why I wanted to stay with that brand. I searched online for something similar to mine, but since they are always changing series, and mine was SO OLD, I didn't have any luck finding a similar model. I didn't really like the looks of this one, but then I started reading the reviews. There was SO MUCH to LOVE about this one! And, the price WAS comparable to what i paid for my old one. And, I DO need something RIGHT NOW. So, I bought it at Walmart. HOW BAD COULD IT BE??I found out about an hour later...I opened the box & pulled it out. It seemed really big to me. Oh, and the carafe wasn't secure, so It fell out onto the floor. And when the lid slammed down, it sounded like a tin penny. I was so used to the deep,smooth 'THUMP' of my old one. And, this one was so flimsy. there was plastic on glass. nothing to give it any coosh. To the point of not being able to control how hard it slapped into the glass. It was so cheap. I already was feeling sad about this choice. But, I went on. I picked it up to go to the kitchen & it seemed to be SO LIGHTWEIGHT. And THIS was the first thing that happened (I don't like where this is going.):When I placed this on the counter, it was wobbling/rocking and wouldn't sit flat, no matter where I put it. I flipped it over, and the 'seams' made in fabrication had not been cleaned up! ESPECIALLY on the two front feet! So, I had to put UNPLUG & FLIP IT ON ITS HEAD to trim all that stuff off. I was afraid to use a razor, cuz I didn't want to gouge the thin plastic, but that's what i ended up using. IT STILL WOULD NOT SIT FLAT. So, I grabbed an emory board & started filing all those rough edges off. THIS IS NOT MY JOB! I was working on that for about 45 & realized this was NOT going to sit well. So to speak. So, I grabbed som medical tape, that was a little spongy, and cut little slits to place over those front feet & level this thing out! Then THIS happened:I placed the machine in the ONE & ONLY space i can use for a coffeemaker. It fit PERFECTLY in that space. HOWEVER, THE WATER WINDOW IS NOW UP AGAINST THE WALL. AND IN THE VERY BACK OF THE UNIT. SO, THAT WINDOW IS NOW USELESS TO ME. AND, I RELY ON THOSE WINDOWS TO SEE IF I'VE ALREADY POURED THE WATER INSIDE & HOW MUCH IS THERE!  NOW, I'LL HAVE TO GUESS... Then, THIS happened:THE FILLING LID OPENS FROM THE LEFT SIDE. THE SIDE WHERE THE WATER WINDOW IS. AND, I CAN'T EVEN SEE WHERE TO POUR THE WATER. THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF CORNER ~ IN THE BACK LEFT SIDE, ~ THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO POUR 12 CUPS OF WATER INTO WITHOUT SPILLING ANYTHING OR GETTING THE PAPER FILTER WET. I CAN'T EVEN SEE INSIDE THIS THING!! THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS. Then THIS happened:I go to set the clock. FINALLY something goes right. EXCEPT I HAVE TO BE ABOUT AN INCH FROM THE SCREEN TO EVEN SEE IT!! WHY IS IT EVEN THERE? I THERE'S NO BACK~~LIGHT. They really didn't need to put that on it. It is 100% USELESS TO ANYONE! So, then THIS happened:I wash the carafe with hot, soapy water ~ as per the instructions. As I'm drying it, I see a LOT of 'smudges' on the glass. So, I try to rub them off with the towel. Nothing. So, I brought it outside to get a better look. THEY ARE SCRAPES & SCRATCHES IN THE GLASS. REALLY?? You couldn't even give me good GLASS?? Come ON!Now for my solution & altercation. All THIS just for a cup of coffee?FIRST, I FILLED THE CARAFE TO THE 12 cup LINE & THEN INTO ANOTHER BOTTLE ~ BECAUSE IT IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO POUR ANYTHING AT THAT ANGLE. AFTER IT WAS ALL IN ANOTHER BOTTLE, I MARKED THE BOTTLE WITH A FILL LINE BECAUSE IT WARNED ME OVER & OVER & OVER THAT I CAN NEVER PUT ANY MORE THAN THOSE 12 cups INTO THE MACHINE!! (oh, and I forgot something. Inside are 2 white things that are also fill lines if you can't see the window. I CAN'T SEE THESE LINES BECAUSE THEY ARE HIDDEN BY THE FILTER CUP WHEN I'M LOOKING IN! ANOTHER useless feature!!) NOW, SINCE I'M STILL IN THE WRONG ANGLE TO POUR, I HAVE TO PLACE A HUGE FUNNEL INTO THAT TINY CORNER SPOT AT THE BACK LEFT HAND SIDE. I COULDN'T USE A SMALL FUNNEL, THERE WAS NO ADVANTAGE TO IT. I NEEDED TO COVER UP ANY AND ALL SPACES THAT WEREN'T WHERE THE WATER WAS SUPPOSED TO GO! AAARRGGHHHH!There are several things that are crystal clear to me now.#1 ~ my OLD unit MUST HAVE BEEN one of Mr. Coffee's ""TOP OF THE LINE"" at the time I bought it. It was amazing! AND SOLID!!! There was NOTHING CHEAP about my old unit. There is no comparison in quality.#2 ~ Mr. Coffee is now owned by SUNBEAM. Sunbeam has always made, what I call, ""THROW AWAY ITEMS"". Items I would rather buy cheap & replace when they get dirty, gunky or broken. Like toasters & heating pads. I'd rather buy a $10 toaster & replace it every couple of years, than to pay $50 & have to clean it for 10-15 years! IT'S A TOASTER. The $10 one STILL MAKES TOAST! And, THIS is a ""$10 toaster"". So, WHY ARE THESE COFFEEMAKERS SO EXPENSIVE? This is a VERY POOR QUALITY ITEM! WHY IS IT $40??And, finally, #3 ~ I am taking my time, right now, to find the RIGHT coffeemaker. One that will make me happy for a long time. When I do find it, I will be RETURNING THIS JUNK.The End."
Joseph A. Hala,1.0,"April 8, 2013","Owned several Mr Coffee machines over the years and needed to get a new one only because I could no longer buy a new carafe which broke. Bought this one based on reviews/price. Unboxed it to find the most irritating ""feature"" that now just makes you place the water filter over the coffee basket. I see others have also complained what happens when the filter slips or you finally get sick of it and toss the filter aside. The designers obviously do not make their own coffee! Save yourself some grief and find a different model. I rebooted mine before even trying it once and returned it."
Robert Hills,5.0,"November 14, 2011","After three months use I can rate this as perfect. It's top rated by Consumer Reports.  The thermal carafe (must purchase separately) is the best way to go, primarily because when the brew cycle is finished the hot plate turns off--saves energy and when making a second pot the coffee maker is already cooled down.  The activated charcoal filter is also great for removing the taste of chlorine from city water.  Overall it is easy and intuitively simple to use.  As with every brand of coffee carafe some care must be taken when pouring the first cup to avoid drips."
Tech junkie,4.0,"October 5, 2014","This is a very good coffee maker in a lot of ways and I would have to agree with Consumer Reports, however...This coffee maker has the same issue as many/most other coffee makers out there.If the machine is left unattended for the whole cycle you will find some of the grounds were not used in the brewing process sue to the water not being poured onto them from the machine.I have found that if half way through the cycle you turn the ground basket you get better results."
Steve Kos,1.0,"November 7, 2014","This is worst coffee maker I have ever owned.  The people who designed it must have never used a drip coffee maker.  The filter must be aligned just right or the water spout causes it to collapse, sending grounds everywhere.  The water level indicator is very hard to see.  The basket does not actually lock in place, and if it is not right, the water and grinds overflow into the reserour.  Since I put a pot of coffee on at 5 A.M., none of these setbacks endear me to this product.  Also, unless you wipe it out after use, the darn thing never dries.  We wash the basket after each use and let the lid stand open.  When we come back 12 hours later, it is still very wet.  There is always water puddled in the lid, basket holder.Stay away from this one!"
P. G.,1.0,"July 29, 2017","I bought this coffee maker 9 months ago.  It worked fine during that time - though putting in the water is a hassle (you have to turn the pot completely upside down to pour in the water).  I could live with that.  I cleaned it when the light came on to clean, used it once a day.  5 days ago it completely stopped working - the water doesn't come through the tubes.  In fact, water started pouring out the back of the machine (there is a little hole there; not sure what it was for).  I am now using it by pouring water I have boiled to make my coffee until I find another one I want to purchase.  Honestly, I should have read the reviews before I bought it.  It wasn't worth the money - even at a low price!!"
deebeefc,1.0,"November 23, 2014","My niece gave me this coffeemaker for an early Christmas present because my Gevalia coffee maker just died. i put full 12 cups of water in the basket to give it its basic cleaning (per instructions). About 1/2-way thru, the machine starting coughing & spitting. I knew it was leaking, and when it completed the cycle, the base was soaken wet, and had dripped onto my countertop & my cabinets underneath. Disappointing. Sending it back. My last Mr Coffee (about 10 years ago) didn't keep the coffee hot enough."
Bethany Wilson,1.0,"July 17, 2013","We bought this coffeemaker at Walmart (in red) because our old one died and we needed an immediate replacement.  I read many of the reviews here before purchasing it.  We have been using it for about 3 months now.  It never had a strong plastic smell, and we have not had any trouble with it leaking or malfunctioning in any way.  The coffee tastes great.One of the reasons we chose this model (in addition to the consumer magazine recommendation and mostly good reviews on Amazon) was the option to use a thermal carafe, since our former coffeemaker had that and we liked it.  However, I haven't even bothered to purchase the optional thermal carafe.  The glass one suits us fine for now.***Update: This unit died after only 5 months of daily use.  Unacceptable.  We exchanged it for another.  Hope the 2nd one will last longer."
ksredhook,2.0,"January 23, 2014",this is not the coffeemaker for you if you like stronger coffee. the stronger setting does not work. I work around this failure by pouring 1/2 of the brewed coffee back over the beans The coffee turns out to be good this way. since the coffee brews so fast the total time would be equivalent to a coffee maker where the strong setting actually worked to slow the brewing time. If you like strong coffee get the black and decker for about  the same price
Hello,2.0,"August 15, 2016","I don't normally write reviews or return items back to stores, but I have to for this product. I just bought this product last week and will be returning it already. The coffee does not brew at a hot enough temperature to produce even decent coffee. I also notice if you leave the coffee in the pot for 20 minutes or longer, it gives the coffee a burnt taste. Therefore, the coffee is not brewed at a hot enough temperature, while the pot heating element is way to hot, so you wind with very mild/bland, burnt tasting coffee. I did a comparison to our old $20 Mr. Coffee machine that just has one button and the $20 machine definitely produced a much better tasting cup of coffee (with the same exact coffee beans) and did not burn the coffee in the pot even after 2 hours. Maybe I received a defective machine but I definitely returned this machine already and will be purchasing something else."
sirb,1.0,"June 20, 2016","My Mr. Coffee stopped working after only 4-1/2 months.  I read lots of reviews and wasn’t going to buy a Mr. Coffee but my husband decided this was the machine for him.  I cautioned him about all the bad reviews across multiple sites but he  insisted that we get this machine.  Sad to say but I get to have my “I told you so” moment.  When it worked, the coffee was ok but not great.  The machine itself was cheap plastic but for the cost I supposed I shouldn’t have expected more.  However, the fact that customer after customer has the same issue – not brewing – should tell the manufacturer that there are serious quality issues with their product.  If you like purchasing a new coffee maker every 2-6 months, then this is the machine for you.  If not, avoid this machine."
Gordie,4.0,"December 5, 2011",This coffee maker surprised me. For the price it's hard to beat. The coffee is hotter than most makers. You do have to pour the coffee very slowly as not to make a mess. Being me I didn't read the directions before setting up the machine. As soon as I did the set up was easy. There are a lot of lights that go off when the machine starts up but that's okay. As an option you can buy a SS pot (about $17) at Walmart if that's what you want. I didn't.  I'll use maker until it quits or stops producing hot coffee.
Sarah,5.0,"September 30, 2018","I just stumbled across the fact I never reviewed this. Bought it 4 years ago, use it almost every day, and it still works perfectly. That kind of dependability makes Mr. Coffee as a brand I recommend to friends."
E. A. Hodge,2.0,"January 19, 2013","I bought this model less than a year ago on here. Up until a week ago, my only complaint was that the glass carafe dripped coffee on the counter while pouring a cup. But, a week ago my maker just stopped brewing and the warming plate would not warm up. After researching on Google, I discovered that the issue most likely is a blown thermal fuse and that Mr. Coffee is notorious for this. Since this happened within the 1 year warranty time frame, I am able to send it Mr. Coffee headquarters for a free repair, but I'm forced to buy a cup at my local Shell Station every morning in the meantime. So, even though this model had excellent features for the price, you run a high risk of it malfunctioning within a short time frame. I would recommend spending a bit more money on a coffee maker that has the same features but is more reliable."
Elaine Hyman,4.0,"September 11, 2014",I got this coffee maker from Costco (my second or third) and I like it and most Mr. Coffee brands a lot; except that my husband keeps breaking the pot in the sink.  The replacement pots I get from Amazon. I am actually looking for a stainless pot to travel with but the reviews are not that good.  The option to make a stronger cup is awesome. Is there a difference in taste from glass pot to stainless steel?  You have to be a coffee drinker to understand the difference of a good vs great coffee maker.
Jennifer,5.0,"February 2, 2013",I love this coffee maker. I've had it about a year now and I have no complaints. I did a lot of research before buying this one because I absolutely hated the one I had before. I like the option to brew stronger coffee and the fact that you can buy a stainless steel carafe if you want. I've replaced the water filter recently and it wasn't expensive. I can brew 4 to 5 cups and the coffee is perfectly hot and the right strength. I have been very pleased with my Mr. Coffee.
William Clegg,1.0,"August 28, 2015","horrible product support from the company-- had it only only month and it just quit working  one day after working earlier in the am.  Because I was honest and told them I had experienced one power outage in that month, even though it worked AFTER the power outage, Latoya and her supervisor at Mr. Coffee service center said that their product failure was ""an act of God"" and that they would not cover a replacement.They suggested that I should unplug  it after every use, even though this model comes with a delayed brewing button and clock to set up for the next morning!I have been using a Mr Coffee since the 70's when Joe DiMaggio advertised for them, but with their condescending customer service they have lost a customer for life and I would advise no one else purchase from this company"
Jimmie,5.0,"October 12, 2011","I had to pay a little more for this at Lowes because I needed it right away for a meeting, so this is a good price. I have tried three other coffee makes in the past 5 years and this is by far the best. I consider it just about perfect after dealing with all the the others that had various annoying flaws. The design is great, it's easy to use and it makes good coffee. I read the reviews where people said it leaked and dribbled and I can't figure out how they made their carafes do that. It makes me wonder if they are even talking about that same coffee maker. It looks good on the counter, is not too big and it gets the job done - hot coffee brewed to your strength preference."
Karsten Weiss,3.0,"July 20, 2015","Machine works fine so far, BUT there is no water filter included. The hardware to INSTALL a water filter is included.

Just so you all know."
Dot Strong,1.0,"June 6, 2016","The problem I am having with this coffee maker is that if you don't get the basket in the PERFECT spot, the water stays in the basket and does not drip into the carafe. Then it the hot water and grounds begin to leak all over the place.I have not noticed a chemical taste, but it's not very hot and it's kind of weak.I will be returning it."
Aldo,1.0,"May 6, 2016",100 Percent JUNK.  Buy this and you will have coffee brewed and SPILLED all over your counter while you are at your groggiest and sleepiest and most desperate for a cup of coffee.  Total POS.  NEVER AGAIN.  (Bought mine at Walmart btw but exact same piece of junk probably made in China by 5 year olds).
Joey,5.0,"January 29, 2014","No more worrying about whether I turned the coffee pot off or not- It automatically turns itself off after 2 hours. I also love that I can chose between strong brew and regular- Half of my family drinks regular, the other half including myself drinks the Strong Brew. Also, This thing is indestructible- PERFECT for clumsy people like myself. When I moved to where I am living now, I dropped the entire thing in the street trying to foolishly carry it plus 2 giant boxes into the new house. I almost cried until I saw not one scratch- And that was one year ago, right after I bought it, and it still works in mint condition. If your whole family is a bunch of coffee drinkers like mine, I strongly recommend this coffee pot."
Bruce Bates,5.0,"January 21, 2013",I recently purchased this coffeemaker and i love it.it has a lot of nice features you usually do not see on coffeemakers in this price range.among the many features of this coffee maker is the delay brew feature that can be programed to make coffee on a time delay basis or for daily brewing as well. just set it and forget it.I have always had my coffee very hot after brewing and i use Folgers Colombian coffee and it tastes very good every pot is perfect and the pause and serve feature is a great feature as well.I also enjoy the delayed brew feature and that is a very nice feature as well.I have not owned this coffee maker for 3 months yet and i have not had a mold or mildew problem yet.My advice would be to dump out the old coffee grounds and rinse out the filter  if it is the permanent type and let it air dry and the same goes for the coffee maker as well try not to get the bottom of the coffee maker wet and using a hose type sprayer from your sink to rinse it out well and turn it upside down and drain it on a towel  and just leave the water filter in a glass of plain water so it stays wet and rinse it off as well in order to keep it clean.
Amazon Customer,1.0,"April 29, 2020","Purchased in February 2020, machine quick working April 29, 2020. Dispensing nozzle interferes with pot top; hard to slide in and out.

Amazon Customer,1.0,"December 4, 2012","Cannot get this coffee maker to make a decent cup of coffee even after rinsing it with vinegar and running several pots of water through it and using bottled water.  To me there is a burned taste.Also you really must get the pot in just so or it will flood the counter with coffee and grounds.Didn't keep the box so I will do what others here have suggested and rinse with vinegar, then baking soda, and air more I guess."
Anonymous,1.0,"January 5, 2016",Doesn't keep the coffee hot at all.  Leaks/drips.  Shuts off way too soon.  Going for another cup and the coffee is cold.  The minimum time for shut off should be four hours-this shuts off after two!  Cold coffee.  Not that a good after reheating.  Shop for better.
pmiller,3.0,"August 11, 2012","After my old Mr. Coffee gave up the ghost (heater failure), I bought one of these. This is definitely a Right-Handed machine. I have found many problems with the Human Inferface:  There's only one water viewing site and it's on the right side that I have to put next to the refrigerator. The 18"" cord is not long enough to locate the machine anywhere else without extension cord. The top opens sideways, therefore if placed on the counter under the low hanging kitchen cabinets, it must be moved to open the top. When the top is open, the water must be poured in from the right side. Otherwise the water spills into the basket. The clock/timer on the front is not visible if you are 6' tall and standing in front of the machine (at 5'4"" it's visible, barely). The black on green LCD clock is not visible from across the room (the old red LED was visible). It has a coffee strength feature that you can no adjust when using the automatic delay start. Otherwise, I thought the coffe that it produced tasted burnt. I'll have to figue out if that's due to the water or the coffee. All coffee makers operate the same way: hot water pours over ground coffee and drains into the pot. For the money, it's a great coffee maker."
What what!!,2.0,"April 29, 2016","I didn't buy from Amazon but did buy from one of the big box stores. The coffee pot worked really nice and the filter did seem to make it taste better. We really liked the way you can set the brew mode to strong or regular. The problem is, the coffee pot isn't durable. True it is used everyday but after 6 months of use, it no longer pushes water thru the machine. For the last two days we have had no coffee. This is not only very inconvenient but also a safety hazard. I have ran into at least three ditches driving to work last two days because my eyes were barely open. My children have been two hours late to school each day because we can seem to get around on time. This coffee pot has been a life changer and not a good way. I only hope I can stay awake long enough today to order a suitable replacemen....."

Betterfli,1.0,"July 17, 2014",The worst tasting coffee I have ever had and that is without exaggeration.  The first cup almost had an electric taste so I ran hot water through the machine again and the second cup tasted like horrible unfiltered soiled water. This machine is LOUD. There were plastic parts that came loose and caught on the filter the three times it was in use. I boxed it up and took it back same day!

J.

It was one of the main reasons I bought this unit.  IT HAS NO SUCH CLEANING CYCLE!

moviemonster,3.0,"October 3, 2014",I don't know all the buttons on this coffee makes and each time a new mess is made and too many things are necessary to use it.  Not as simple as putting in the coffee and water and waiting for a quick brew.  Some things just don't need to be complicated in life and this is not easy when you get up and want a quick cup of coffee.  May be me but it is not that easy to use.

I really don't want to budget in a new coffee maker every 3 months so i would advise if you you drink coffee now and then then this would be a nice piece in your kitchen but if you enjoy more than a pot a day well i would look elsewhere. This unit is not the Mr Coffee of old
HAJ,2.0,"April 18, 2012","First let me say that all the good comments that have been made about this coffee maker I have found to be true, but after a few months of use I found something that's not so good. Have any of you ever tried taking a paper towel and rubbing out the inside of the water reservoir or used your water sprayer at your sink to spray the reservoir out?  After 3 months of use, using it with the water filter, I wiped the inside out to find mold and mildew; not just a little, it was covered with the pink and brown stuff.  Then after another 3 months, after I had quit using the filter (I opted for distilled water instead) I sprayed out the water reservoir and discovered brown slime. Again, it wasn't just a few specks; there were globs of the stuff...yuck.  So maybe the plastic is supposed to have some sort of anti-mold/ bacteria qualities that mine, for whatever reason, does not have. However, I do think it could perhaps be the design, as the lid not only covers the water reservoir, but also the wet coffee grounds and is not vented to let out the condensation.  I think maybe while I was using the water filter, this kept the condensation from the wet coffee grounds from gathering on the lid and dripping coffee condensation into the water reservoir to cause the moldy brown slime. But even when using the filter, the warm wet reservoir is still a good breeding ground for the mold and mildew considering there is not a vent to let the moisture escape.  Apparently adding the coffee condensation just made it grow into something extra special yucky. Oh, and cleaning it with vinegar does not clean this stuff; it was right after I cleaned it with vinegar that I sprayed out the inside and discovered I had been drinking coffee made with water poured into a petri dish.As I indicated I only think to clean it about every 2 or 3 months and maybe I should clean it more often (actually since discovering the brown slime a few weeks ago, I plan on cleaning it again this weekend), but I've never seen anything like this with my past coffee makers no matter how long I went between cleanings. I'm curious to know if anyone else has this problem...?"
AJWheeley,1.0,"April 22, 2016","I loved it when I first got it but it broke after about 6 months and I did not even use it regularly.  It still makes coffee when I plug it in but none of the buttons work and I have to unplug it or it just stays on.  Very disappointed in this, I had such high hopes."
Stephen High,1.0,"January 22, 2014","I bought this coffee maker and after about 6 months, the inside started smelling like an old hot tub and the coffee tasted awful, like rank water had been used. Being a fan of Mr. Coffee, I thought this was a fluke.  I bought a replacement one for our home as well as purchasing one for our office. Same thing happened to both of these coffee makers. I believe what is happening is that the water does not fully drain into the coffee maker, never giving the  water container a chance to fully dry. We used vinegar, baking soda and finally bleach but nothing worked to clean it out, it was permanently infused into the plastic. We had no other choice but to throw them away. I am hesitant to buy Mr. Coffee again. It has left a bad taste in my mouth."
HC,5.0,"April 19, 2014","So, just to insert something here about the bad reviews pertaining to plastic-y taste and smell.  There are two reasons for this.One reason is the plastic and epoxies used in manufacturing (probably more the epoxies than the plastics but...)The other is the Styrofoam packing materials which exude gas.  The gases are then trapped in the packaging for weeks or months, permeating the coffee makerAs an experiment, when you buy a new coffee maker...assuming you're replacing your old one with one of the same type...use your old filter basket and carafe.  You'll find that you have zero bad taste in your next cup of coffee.  And leave the new basket and carafe out for a couple weeks before using it (if you even need to).  By then the gases will have dissipated and you will be good to go."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"August 5, 2016","This is my second replacement BVMC-SJX33GT-RB with the last one being sent on 10/05/2015 and now the heating element is no longer working. I have owned many Mr Coffee brand coffee makers and have had several issues over the last several years. The customer service rep indicated that even though the new replacement coffee maker was sent on 10/5/2015 and is less than 12 months old, they could not replace it and wanted me to purchase a new one. I will look to another brand based on this service. I wrote this exact review on the Mr Coffee website and they are censoring this same post and sent email indicating it didn't meet their guidelines.  I'm sure since it pointed out their poor customer service."
Harvey T,3.0,"March 11, 2014","Although this machine makes perfectly acceptable, not great, coffee, it has one annoying flaw. A few seconds into the brew cycle it loudly beeps to let you know how hard it is working. Why?? It's annoying to those housemates still asleep and there is no way to turn it off. It's like that smoke alarm that starts with the low battery beep at two in the morning."
Dolores M. Gunning,2.0,"October 6, 2015","I was initially impressed by the good reviews of this coffeemaker and ordered it.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.  After seveal months, the coffee began tasting weaker and did not have a good flavor even though I consistently used the ""stronger"" coffee selection. I kept changing coffee brands plus adding more coffee but it continued to produce a cup of coffee that had very little flavor. Also, after 1/2 hour the remaining coffee was extremely bitter.  Very disappointed in this particular model.  Unfortunately, this is the second Mr. Coffee maker that I found to be less than satisfactory.  Still looking for a good coffeemaker under $50."
Victor,2.0,"July 15, 2014","not as good as the one I replaced (another brand) as the taste is somehow not as robust.  somehow the taste is flat... bland.  perhaps because it is a basket filter than a ""cone"" shape that allows the coffee to be in contact with the water more and therefore more extraction of taste???  All I know is I just don't get as good of a coffee as before even though I use more beans than before and still -the taste is not there.  Too clumsy for me too as it could be much better design."
Dan Flynn,5.0,"May 4, 2014","Heats water at a high enough temperature to produce a great cup of coffee, and the features are helpful. Though I will say that, because of the complaints that the water had a plastic taste, I ended up brewing 4 pots of a water/vinegar mixture before I brewed my first pot of coffee. After doing so, I have had no such plastic taste from mine.The only negative I have is sometimes the timer is too fast and doesn't keep accurate time."
amazon buyer,5.0,"December 10, 2013","We have had this coffee maker for a good 6 months or so and LOVE it. My husband drinks coffee continuously, so the coffee maker is on as long as he is home... and has yet to disappoint! Even when just turning the burner on to warm up the coffee from the morning, the coffee gets nice and hot. We hope to have this machine for a long time, and if something does ever happen to it... we will be buying the same one again. The price is reasonable. The quality of the coffee is delicious. The coffee is hot."
Penelope Pepperpants,1.0,"August 9, 2013","We purchased this coffee maker about a month ago and it worked fine, until about a week ago when it started leaking huge puddles of water all over the counter every time we brewed a pot of coffee.  I took it back to the store, exchanged it for a new one, and the first time we used it it did the exact same thing- huge puddle of water all over the counter.  I can't believe Mr. Coffee can get away with selling such a crappy product- I will never buy one of their products again."
Samuel Medina,1.0,"December 16, 2014","Do not bother buying this coffee machine,  the brew basket broke within 2 months and you cannot get a replacement part from Mr Coffee or anywhere else on the Internet.  I looked into it and the brew basket is defective I found several people who purchased this machine and ran into the same problem. So I'm stuck with a coffee machine that can't brew coffee. Very disappointed with Mr Coffee co."
Epsikk,1.0,"November 11, 2014",This machine gives off a terrible plastic smell. It makes the coffee also taste like plastic. I have been cleaning it every day before use and it has helped but it is becoming too much of a hassle and I'm going to replace mine. Too bad because I like the features and the look of the machine.
Leslie Nix,2.0,"May 13, 2014","Bought this coffee maker 8 days ago based on good reviews for the past 3 years in CU. Problem is I measured a 181 degree temperature of the coffee with a consequent wimpy flavor, using freshly ground beans.According to CU the industry standard for fresh brewed coffee is 195 to 205 degrees. I placed a call to Mr. Coffee, told the answering party of the temperature I measured and was told that was an acceptable temperature to per the company. I will be returning this coffeemaker to the retailer for refund to seek a better machine."
John Vaughn,2.0,"November 17, 2014","After 4 years of use, water started leaking out the back of machine when coffee was programmed for party. After further inspection, we noticed a crack in the water well. I had to go back to my old (what used to be white before discoloration) Mr. Coffee 12-cup machine. I also noticed how much hotter the coffee is when made in the OLD machine. The reviews are correct about this new coffee maker not making the coffee very hot. I noticed it when I purchased it but I have to re-zap my coffee all the time anyway because I always leave it sitting around and don't drink it fast enough. Bottom line, my old ugly coffee machine works better than this new black/chrome version."
Tony Gartrell,1.0,"April 30, 2015",I have no idea how this thing has an average of 4 stars...  The basket for the filter doesn't sit in the cradle very well.  You have to make sure it is there perfectly or it pops out and you end up with a huge mess.  Twice in the first week I have spent 20 minutes cleaning up a mess.  If you put the filter in first and put the pot in it is very easy to slight jar the filter out of place and have it over flow.  It doesn't lock into place at all and if it over flows it gets everywhere and flows back into the reservoir and clogs it up with grounds.  Also the coffee seem weak compared to other makes I have had.  Throwing this POS out and getting something that works.
School Shopper,1.0,"March 12, 2017",what a surprise - exactly 6 weeks after the 1 year warranty expired the coffee pot just QUIT working.  Don't know how this had such high ratings.  Guess I should have purchased the 3 or 5 year extended warranty.  Would have expected it to last longer than this. Not happy especially since I gave it as a gift.
bean,1.0,"July 20, 2013","I have 2 other family members with this same machine that we all got at Christmas. They both complained about theirs leaking within the first 3 months, but I had no problems...until now...7 months later. Mine leaked overnight, but I did not notice the standing water until the next day. This has caused my cheapo countertops to swell and the laminate to start peeling off. Now I need a new coffee maker AND new countertops!"
Amazon Customer,1.0,"September 2, 2017","The coffee maker itself works well yet, the flask has been redesigned with a plastic rim that blocks the flow of the coffee. This fills the rim and it drips all over the counter, when pouring the coffee into the cup. And when washing the flask out, the flask continues to drip old coffee down the side of the flask and onto the counter or floor or... You would think, a Company that deals with liquid, would know better then to add a rim that creates a dam for water flow."
saltydog,2.0,"October 9, 2013","after checking on websites for a mr coffee replacement, i took an interest is this coffeemaker.  after taking a good look i saw that the top opens to the left.  wonder what genius decided this was an improvement over the standard!  i must be expected to turn this around when i fill it. i will purchase a comparable item by another maker."
Jason James,4.0,"March 1, 2011","After our old Black & Decker coffee maker died, I wanted to make sure to get a nice-looking new one with some additional functionality. Came very close to buying a Cuisinart that cost twice as much, but then I saw this one. Has all the features I was looking for (delay timer, brew-pause, optional thermal carafe, coffee strength), and at a great price! From what I can tell, it makes a very good cup of coffee, though I'm no connoisseur. My only complaint is that the buttons on the front feel cheap and flimsy; I predict they won't last much more than a year before they start sticking or become unresponsive. But overall, this is a great coffee maker at a great price!"
Crystal D Vowels,1.0,"May 28, 2014",Well of course I can not find my receipt. I am just glad I was actually just sitting here. It started making the normal sputtering sounds after coffee was already brewed. Did not think anything of it until smoke started rolling out of the back of the unit. Yep not happy. I purchased this for the 'safety' of the 2 hr shut off feature. So much for that.
Chris,5.0,"May 8, 2015","This unit has served us faithfully in the office for months now... We brew about 10 pots of coffee a week and have zero complaints!Zero complaints isn't an automatic five-star though... The unit is a low-price leader, looks good (enough) and makes tasty coffee. The feature-set is perfect!"
Elizabeth Horton,2.0,"August 7, 2021",Coffee grinds in every pot no matter what you do.
ShooterJ,2.0,"November 29, 2014","Works great,  easy operation.  After running at least 20 pots of water through it,  still has an extremely strong taste of plastic.  Thought for sure it would be gone by now,  but almost seems to be getting worse.  I would highly recommended staying away from this product"
Bob,5.0,"December 31, 2015","I've had mine so long the lettering under the on/off button has worn off. The main unit has survived 4 pots, the 5th one has now developed a crack but the main unit still works great. I get up at 6:15 every day and there is hot coffee ready for when I walk the dogs. Going to replace it with the same unit because after many years of use this one isn't quite as hot or fast as it used to be. I definitely got my moneys worth out of this one. Will be kept for when we have lots of company so I can brew reg & decaf."
J. Bunck,1.0,"March 12, 2017","Pure cheap junk, hard to pour water in it with out getting back splash, cheap internal filter system. You would thing a coffee maker would be the simplest thing in the world to operate...wrong."
Clark,1.0,"June 23, 2017","Lasted 17 months. I liked it other than the loud beeping that you can't disable. Worked fine Friday morning, then the next morning... nothing. Lights up and clicks but no heat.  Do yourself and the Earth a favor and spend the extra money for something that lasts longer. My previous Mr. Coffee maker lasted for maybe a decade so I gave them another chance... oh well."
Neil B. Standish,1.0,"January 8, 2016","We took delivery of this garbage on August 6, 2015.  We've used it twice a day since that time. Today, January 8, 2016 Mr. POS no longer powers on. That's 5 short months and it's ready for the recycling transfer center to dispose of properly. We will never by another Mr. Coffee and I urge you to reconsider your decision to purchase this brand. I would've scored this a zero - a one is too kind."
John,5.0,"May 6, 2015","I've had a couple of Mr. Coffee's over the years and my last one was Meh....I got this one because the basket on my other one broke. I LOVE this coffee maker! It brews HOT and use less coffee to get a strong brew, plus it has all the features that my last one had that I spend $30 more for. I highly recommend it."
MELVIN,5.0,"October 20, 2014","I had issues with a Hamilton Beach Brewstation which leaked after first use (used from Amazon) and returned it and just went to the Wal.... to look for a coffee maker. I read reviews on Amazon and noticed this was a Amazon best seller and chose this model. This is a great coffee maker, brew great tasting coffee, auto 2 hour turnoff, looks great and easy operation and no leaking. So if your looking for a great easy use coffee maker look no further  over 1200 5 stars reviews are correct and order this model."
Susan,1.0,"March 27, 2014","This coffee maker is the worst I have ever purchased! When you make 10 cups or more, sometimes it will not release the coffee through the coffee grinds. You will wind up having the coffee on your counter, or back in the filtration system. At first I thought it was my coffee filter that was too small. I then changed to a large filter, but it happened again, for probably the 15th time. I believe the opening on the bottom is too small. Even though this is inexpensive, it's still a waste of money. Now I need to buy another one."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"September 24, 2016","Worst coffee maker ever! Coffee tastes like burnt rubber. And to make matters worst, when checking the Mr. Coffee site, they blame it on me because I'm using an inferior coffee (same stuff I've been using for 20 years) or that it's my water (same water I've been using for 25 years), or that the one-month-old coffee maker is dirty - GIVE ME A BREAK!! Trying a couple more suggestions from the Web to get rid of taste and then into the garbage it goes. Never, never, never will I purchase a Mr. Coffee product again - NEVER!"
Elaine,1.0,"June 14, 2015",Smells and tastes like plastic.  We used it for about a month hoping the plastic taste would eventually go away. Never happened!  This cannot be healthy as I'm sure some of the plastic is leaching into the coffee.  This Chinese junk won't float.
George,5.0,"November 21, 2015",Working well. First one did not automatically pick up the glass pot.  It thought carafe was under so it brewed and shut off.  Coffee got cold. Company replaced quickly!  It was odd to have a maker without a switch for glass pot or carafe.
Benjamin,1.0,"March 11, 2020","This garbage device works for a month or two and then stops. The burner stops working, it quits after 1/3 a cup of coffee is brewed (so not clogged), and it just beeps a lot. Horrible machine. Horrible company. Just horrible."
Keith Swann,5.0,"December 29, 2015","I have owned this coffee machine for about a year and a half now. It makes a decent cup of coffee! I have no complaints. The brew strength gimmick is a gimmick.........seriously. But If you know how much grounds you need for your own personal tastes....who cares. I've spent 3 times more on a machine that didn't last nearly as long as this. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one. If they've not changed in their manufacturing since I purchased it, it should still be the same good brewer. Don't hesitate to buy it. You just need to figure out the amount of grounds you like....that's all. I don't agree with their measurements in their manual. Truthfully, if you haven't stepped into grinding your own beans, you don't know what you are missing."
Chantal,1.0,"January 10, 2018",This is by far the WORST coffee maker I ever owned! I wasted so much coffee because of the filter folding with water & cofee running all over the counter & what a mess! Those things are dangerous & useless! Do not get caught! I absolutely hate it but gave good $ for it. It’s going in the trash! I wouldn’t give that to my enemies!
Jennifer Henson,4.0,"December 8, 2014",I really like coffee maker.  Thee first few cups of coffee tasted pretty nasty even though  I ran clear water through it three times.  After the first few cups it was smooth sailing.I am purchasing a water filtration disc for it.  We have hard water so I think that will make the coffee even better.  Will update when I get it.  Very happy with this product.
Valerie Nelson,1.0,"January 25, 2020",This coffee pot only lasted 8 months total. Leaked water through the bottom only after 4 months. Then the carafe handle broke at 8 months.
lucababe,4.0,"November 3, 2013",The coffee is tasty and hot. The glass container is water stained after one month. Water does drip out when first turned on to brew. The price reflects the coffee maker operation and value. The pumping system stopped after 1 month of use. Can't take back but must find a dealer to fix.
Kay k,5.0,"September 29, 2014","Hot coffee that taste's great,  finally !!!  I am a picky coffee drinker :).  I want it hot after I add my cream I also want it to taste like coffee, not plastic or some other weird chemical taste.  I ran water through the pot as many time's as instructed.  The first few days it had that new plastic taste but by the fourth or fifth day of brewing I was happy with the result's , no more weird taste's :)  I have purchased other name brands and more expensive coffee makers and I'm always disappointed.  This is the best one so far, love it!"
Robin,4.0,"October 11, 2014",It works great and makes coffee quickly. The only thing that is just an annoyance for me is it doesn't stop making coffee when you pull the pot out. IT keeps dripping so it makes a mess.  I know that I can wait!! Sometimes I just want coffee so bad.  Other than that it works very well. I am happy with it.
j,4.0,"January 22, 2014",I have nothing good or bad to say about this coffee maker. It's perfectly adequate. I bought it on a lightning deal and and am satisfied; if I paid the current price for it I would expect it to tell jokes or do tricks or in some other way brighten my morning.If you want coffee this makes it.
DKirps,1.0,"March 25, 2016",The coffee machine stopped working within a month of using it. Very upset that it didnt even make it to a month. I would NOT recommend buying this product.
Amazon Customer,2.0,"December 15, 2015","I find the water filter to be very annoying. Being loose and in 2 pieces it's just more pieces to clean and I have a hard time setting the filter in place properly.  I've decided I just won't use the filter.Also, I have yet to figure out how to pour from the decanter without making a mess.  I find it difficult to pour the water into the reservoir.I've had other Mr Coffee machines that I liked much better than this one."
Hali Kwanis,4.0,"December 14, 2013","I have had several coffee makers and was getting tired of them starting to decline in performance after a couple of years. I still did not want to pay a huge premium for a top notch coffee maker but wanted something that was good and affordable. After some research I went with the Mr. Coffee coffee maker and it has been two months and it is still working well. It makes the coffee hot like I like it to be and no problems. For the money this is one of the best ones out there, trust me I have gone through three previous ones."
Carol A.,4.0,"June 26, 2014","I like everything about this coffee maker, except for the fact that the clock isn't lit.  The coffee itself is quite hot, the hottest I have ever experienced with these type coffee makers.  That is a real plus.  Don't hesitate ordering one for yourself.  Quality and price are great."
Sailgirl,2.0,"March 12, 2015","I have to agree with many other reviewers. This coffee pot makes the worst coffee I've ever made at home. There is a smell (Not coffee-ish) and an off taste to the coffee of every pot we've made in the last couple of months. I don't know if we'll get any $$ back, I just want to enjoy my coffee in the a.m.Don't buy this coffee pot if you love coffee."
Spaceman,1.0,"March 31, 2014","Despite being highly rated by Consumer Reports, upon which I based my purchase (from another store), I found this unit to be horrible.  1.  The coffee came out warm, not hot, though the hot plate heated it further.  2.  Using the stronger brew setting caused the unit to beep and shut off a few seconds after starting.  3.  The drip-stop feature dribbled, and condensation caused further dripping.  I returned it for a Cuisinart which is superior in every way so far."
Deonna,1.0,"August 8, 2015","Worst coffee pot, broke after 5 months. Lights still come on but it never brews! Went on mr coffee website to troubleshoot and it says to take it into a repair center of which there were none."
Smokey,3.0,"January 12, 2011","This model SJX33GT is the simpler version of BVMC-SJX33GT; without the cleaning cyle option. This model does have the option of using the metal decanter which is sold separately. I intend to buy the metal decanter or replacement glass carafe, because every time I pour a cup of coffee; it drips on the counter. Other members of the household have commented on this, so it is not just how I am pouring it.Except for this leaking problem, the coffemaker is ideal in everyway. It's a shame."
lmf580,3.0,"August 22, 2015","Have had this for about two years. It just quite 3 months ago. Got the part and fixed it it just quite AGAIN today. Going to junk it and go back to my old Black & Decker. When it worked the coffee was ""ok"" but not as great as the reviews had said. I think it was over rated."
KS,3.0,"September 29, 2017",As with all Mr.Coffee makers they last about a year.  I would not recommend anyone buy unless on sale at  good price.
T. Hawke,2.0,"January 28, 2012","I have had this for 2 months, I make coffee almost every day. I have experimented with it  great deal. I buy very good coffee but I cannot get a good cup of coffee out of this thing. It still tastes like plastic, and it will invariably dump coffee grounds into the carafe.  I will be buying a different coffee maker and will stay away from Mr. Coffee completely."
Anastasia Elise,1.0,"August 26, 2016","Started out as a great machine but now, a few months later the beeper that indicates the coffee is done keeps going off right after brewing begins good."
Michael K. Mathis,1.0,"March 26, 2012","This is absolutely the worst coffee pot I have ever had. Every step in making the coffee is a disaster.  You can not pour water or coffee from the carafe without it dripping everywhere.  You need to hold the cheap plastic lid UP whenever you pour.  Once you manage to get water in the coffee maker,  make sure you position it just right or you will have a mess. 10 minutes after the coffee has been brewed, it smells and tastes burnt. We ended up giving this coffee pot to the GoodWill after 3 weeks of terrible coffee. I went to Macy's and got a great deal on a cuisinart with a metal carafe for only $20.00 more and couldn't be happier!"
Waysider,1.0,"May 13, 2016","So far, this has been nothing but an annoying disappointment. The carafe broke when we took it out of the box. So we bought another Mr Coffee carafe,  but apparently this model comes with a fancy shaped one that isn't interchangeable with other Mr Coffee 12 cup carafes from the EJX, LMX, VMX, ISA, and FTX series.  So I've had this for a week, and paid twice, and I'm feeling a bitter taste, but I haven't had a cup of coffee yet."
R.E. Dillon,5.0,"September 5, 2015","had thd unit for a long time now, i'm very picky about my cofee, always end up back with Mr. Cofee. buy good beans! Your cofee is only ss fresh as what you put in it! no plastic smell here!!!!"
Vet Sue,5.0,"May 17, 2014",We have had many different brands of coffeemakers over the years but we are sticking with this coffeemaker. It brews any brand of coffee to perfection. We especially like that we can choose to brew the coffee stronger or regular strength.
Dogwood,4.0,"November 13, 2011","I am a coffee drinker and considered a pod machine but what the heck, just one cup? I studied the reviews and decided to go with this one.  Have no problem with the plastic smell that some have mentioned.  Two small negatives that I do have are the display is not lit and can not see in dim light and the sight gage is on the wrong side for the position I have it on the counter, but I can live with these, it makes a great cup of coffee."
Michael F. Moss,3.0,"March 24, 2013","Pros:Easy to use.Easy to set the clock.The carafe doesn't spill like my previous coffee maker.Cons:Clock is not backlit.Water filter is in a poor location.The ""strong"" button makes very weak coffee.The ""regular"" button makes slightly coffee flavored water.The water filter is a disc that sits on top of the brew basket. The filter has to be removed to fill the basket. The HOT filter has to be removed to empty the basket. The filter has to be carefully placed or it will fall into the basket."
Douglas P.,5.0,"February 25, 2018","Bought my Mr Coffee TWELVE years ago.  It has given me great-tasting caffeinated (Eight O'Clock whole bean ground to order) coffee 7 days a week all those years.

Amazon Customer,1.0,"January 20, 2019",It is easier to perform brain surgery than to operate this machine. The manual is confusing. It requires paper filter. Just get a french press. Coffee is supposed to be a simple beverage.

bella,1.0,"December 7, 2011","I bought this unit, cleaned it used it many times desperite for that first cup of java. Finally thought why am I drinking this when it still smells & tastes like plastic...Could smell it in another room in the house! I contacted the Mr Coffee company and inquired if there had been other complaints (sorry I did not look on this site prior to my purchase) She said there were no other complaints. They sent me another unit (different model)6 weeks later after I called again...same thing only not quite so strong. Today  the smell and taste was strong again (noticed by 2 different users). My worry is what chemicals are creating this odor and taste...I'm not using this brand again...there is a mutant finger growing out of my face!"
LJ Veteran,5.0,"July 9, 2015",Just what we were looking for. A regular coffee pot with a few additional features. I love that I can make it the night before and it will be ready for me before work in the morning. It also has a great feature to make your coffee stronger...as I like a dark roast and prefer stronger blends. It is fairly easy to clean and also comes with an optional water filter.
M,5.0,"September 9, 2015","Makes great coffee (only with great beans.) Pot, lid & basket clean perfectly in dishwasher. Schedule cycle works as expected. Pour while brewing is really nice at this price."
BossaBooks,1.0,"July 9, 2014",Plastic taste in the coffee is HORRIBLE and will not go away. Have had it for two months and have tried cleaning it in every way possible. I will probably have to throw it away because I don't think any human should be drinking this swill.

Jeff,1.0,"July 30, 2012","This machine is designed so that you can pour a cup of coffee while it is still brewing. It is designed so poorly thatthe basket will float up when the carafe is put in the machine causing the valve to not open and the basket will overflowwith coffee and grounds.This happened three times in a row, on the third time the overflow got into the machine and shorted theelectronics.This is the biggest piece of s*** Mr. Coffee has ever put out for sale. They will tell you it is because the filter collapsed and you needto buy a permanent filter. This is bunk, it is because nothing holds the basket down and the water overflows.Junk, Junk, Junk. Do not waste your money on this."
Slider's Mom,1.0,"January 12, 2012","We purchased this coffee pot about 3 months ago mainly due to the high rating from Consumer Reports.  We are ready to throw it in the trash.  The stopper in the bottom of the basket has malfunctioned several times, causing scalding coffee to overflow and run all over the counter.  The digital display on the clock is already unreadable.  The lights on the display panel are starting to flicker.  And the final straw is it won't finish a brew cycle anymore.  We normally brew 8 cups and all we get out is 6.  The cycle is also taking at least twice as long as it did when the pot was new.  We'll never purchase another Mr Coffee after this experience."

M. D. THOMAS,5.0,"November 10, 2012","don't over think buying this coffee maker. looks good, works great,coffee taste depends on the coffee you use and how much. I never use as much coffee as recommended...but that is up to personal taste."
DebStan,5.0,"July 30, 2014",Had a more expensive coffee maker that just wasn't working well anymore.  Decided to try Mr Coffee after reading reviews.  We are very pleased with it!  Makes great coffee.  Would recommend.
Kate,1.0,"July 18, 2013","Had coffee maker for 2 months, smelled plastic burning and now coffee pot will not make coffee.  Search for reviews using model number (BVMC-SJX36GT) and you  will find one site with 238 complaints.  Do not buy this coffee pot.  Subtract 1 star from my star rating for accurate rating."
coffeelover,1.0,"November 3, 2013","First i bought this coffeemaker about 9 months ago when i used it for about 2 weeks it starded to gurgle as soon as you turned on then only brewed 1/4 of the pot.So i thought its just defected coffeemaker so i exchanged for a new one it worked fine for 8 months makes good coffee but what happens now is the steam from the machine gets in to the program board end shortcuts the board and you can not turn it off or set the timer, now it does not even turn on so use caution thi product should be recalled cause i think its not safe."
Susan T.,4.0,"February 13, 2011","This is a nice programmable coffee 12-cup coffee maker that accepts both a 12-cup carafe and an 8-cup thermal carafe.  With the brew strength option, you can satisfy most tastes.  Good design; easy pour carafe.The product is well packaged, but ours was lacking the filter disk for the included water filter system.  A quick email to their customer service got a polite response within the stated 2-business days and the filter a week later.The challenge with this product is one voiced about many coffee makers these days - an acute plastic smell taste, even after following the initial cleaning directions.  (but since so many models/brands seem to have this problem we thoguht it worth the effort to try to work past it)It took two days of effort to rid ourselves of this plastic taste ... we did 2 rounds of cleaning with vinegar-water followed by clean water and then two rounds of cleaning with baking soda in water (3T to 12 cups, letting it sit in the resevoir for 30 minutes before brewing, followed by clean water.  We used a paper filter and not our permanent filter for this. After the first day, the odor was noticeably reduced, but still detectable.  We left water in the resvoir overnight and the hatch open and then repeated the process again the next day.Since then, we've had very good tasting coffee and a very nice functioning machine."
Jonny5 Alive,4.0,"April 16, 2014","I've owned this for about half a year now and it is splendid. Do not try to wash the heating element, it is painted and will scratch/rust.Otherwise, it is a fine coffee maker and I hope they sell the coffee pot separately as I broke mine and I just want the glassware part now."
Dale Stradinger,2.0,"May 28, 2017",Loved the coffee pot. Looked great. Functioned well. The first one quit working after a year. We had purchased a warranty protection plan so a new one was sent. The second coffee machine lasted about 8 months. Our previous Mr Coffee machines have not lasted long either. Won't be buying this brand again.
Shawn,1.0,"March 4, 2016",Ordered this item for a military deployment. I received it during the second week in January 2016. It doesn't work after using it for less than 60 days. Piece of junk that I can't even return. Guess I'll have to go with another brand.
JudithK,3.0,"April 30, 2016","Arrived without any damage to the unit and it works great.The only reason this got three stars from is that it had this plastic, chemical smell from it. It did not affect the taste of the coffee though"
wyo,3.0,"August 7, 2014","I bought it about 1 month ago, bad plastic taste, it slowly went away in about a week making a pot every day. But the water filter still left small taste. I don't use that anymore, I set it on brew strong, taste good now. It is fast to brew. setting for thermal was stuck on, so machine would shut off after done brewing. I unplugged it, plugged it back in. then it was on glass, does'nt shut off now. other than that, got to get use to it's functions."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"April 8, 2015",I purchased this system from my local big box store last summer. The system stared to smell like it was burning. The coffee started tasting awful. When I checked on the warranty there wasn't anywhere in my area to take it and it wouldn't be covered because they say its the water that caused it. NOT!! The water I use is bottle water so there are no minerals in the water. This machine is a piece of junk!!
KirkD,3.0,"November 7, 2014",Makes good Coffee but I bet the guy that designed it never tried to pour water in it before production got ahold of it....

SASHAH,1.0,"November 20, 2012",I have never written this bad of a review for any product or service in my life.  Guess there is always the first.  I purchased Mr. Coffee coffee maker and paid over $120 last december.  The coffe maker clock stoped working and water vapors appearing on the glass.  The Coffe maker was taking over an hour to make a pot of coffee.  And finally it wont even come on - dead as a door knob.I called the Mr. Coffee which is owned by Sunbeam and taked to the customer rep and finally the manger.  They refused to repair and send in a replacement - just becuase I did not had the original reciept.I fully agree whith their corporate policy - but the fact remains the same that it is a faulty and inferior product.  It seemd to me that they dont take pride in their product and do not beleive in after sale support.They must be getting tons of complaints for them to completly refuse support and hide behind some receipt.  When they can very well tack the product by serial number and a unique code desplayed on the side of the power plug.I do not recommend Mr. Coffee products to anyone - Save your money and look elsewhere
Kerry Wan Olson,5.0,"October 12, 2015","I love that everyone can have exactly whatever kind or flavor of coffee that they want. No more having to drink chocolate peppermint coffee in the morning because I wasn't the first one up and I don't want to waste a whole pot. I also love that it's always a fresh cup of coffee. No more burnt, old coffee. Just a nice fresh cup."

Reader Lovesbooks,1.0,"December 20, 2014","The clock burned out after we used it 3 times, so we can no longer set our coffee to brew before we wake up, which was why we bought this in the first place.  It also takes about 30 minutes to brew a full pot of coffee."
Chris Cozzolino,1.0,"March 24, 2015","I bought this unit on March 11,2015 and this morning something inside melted all I could smell was plastic burning, that's what you get when you use plastic to make everything, wont be buying another, very dissatisfied."

James,3.0,"February 24, 2015","This did the job, while it lasted: The machine inexplicably stopped brewing less than two months after I purchased it. Customer service for the manufacturer was reasonable and promised to send a replacement quickly. I'm hoping for the best."

Kraemer,4.0,"April 25, 2015",4/24/2015Just purchased this unit at a local Walmart. It was very easy to set up and get a pot brewing quickly. No real issues one way or the other. Brew temp is very hot as I would like and the brew strength was very pleasing as well. Overall very solid bang for the buck!
Richard Andre,5.0,"August 17, 2018","Just a note of thanks for your prompt replacement of a new Mr Coffee that didn't work.  Have 4 coffee makers, all yours!  Many thanks.  Richard"

Patricia P. Ellis,2.0,"March 30, 2016","I have had 2 of these. After a year or two, BOTH started leaking about a cup or more of cold water from the bottom while brewing.I have contacted the company for a new one or a refund; they have not replied."

noggin,1.0,"March 31, 2015","I had this coffee pot for three years and loved it, right up until it died. Now, I wouldn't be mad about it dying, if it hadn't been caused by how the coffeepot is designed. While it's brewing the coffee, steam rises up over the electronic control panel. Run it often enough and this control panel gets saturated with water and goes kaput. Poor design."
JustSomeGuyAtAltitude,1.0,"April 28, 2016","Nice looking coffee maker, but I never knit it will make a good batch of coffee. It doesn't heat the water up hot enough during brewing to properly extract coffee from the grounds, nor does it distribute water evenly over the grounds. I've tried everything & this morning I give up."
Nayge,1.0,"January 7, 2013",Cannot get rid of a toxic smell and taste in the water. This is a common problem in coffee makers today (returned a Keurig for that). Be careful people these companies care more about their bottom line than your health.
Mark Hayden,4.0,"January 19, 2013",It does everything it says it should. I love strong turkish grind coffee in the early am before my workout. This coffee maker has a setting for 'regular' and 'strong'. It makes a difference to my liking and always works when programmed. Easy to use and maintain. The H2O filter is also a nice add on.
LM0486,5.0,"May 25, 2016","Have had this coffee pot for a year and a half. Slower brew, but coffee tastes great and most importantly no leaks like our old pot. The delay works great also.Some friends and family purchased the same pot after having coffee at our house."
Travis A Taylor,1.0,"June 12, 2015","Seems like all Mr Coffee coffeemakers have issues.  From what I have read lately, most of these coffeemakers do not last more than two years max.  It does make a good cup of coffee, but just be prepared to buy something else in a few years.  I made this mistake, and will not be getting anything with Mr Coffee on it anymore."
Susan F,1.0,"March 3, 2016","I love the look of this machine, But my first one died at 6 months, and now the 2nd has also died ... I will not be purchasing another Mr Coffee machine."
David G Sillman,2.0,"May 7, 2014","The coffee maker itself is fine, but I bought the thermal carafe (in addition to the glass one that comes with it) and its supposed to brew with either pot. Unfortunately the thermal one never worked. The machine can sense which carafe is being used and when I use the thermal one, it beeps at me and shuts off."
Mark Rose,1.0,"January 31, 2016","Received this as a Christmas gift, and while it worked, it brewed great coffee. Didn't have the plastic taste of other reviewers. However, it has died already, not even lasting a full month. It has power, but never heats up. Worked fine one day, stopped the next."
argo,3.0,"January 8, 2015","It's slow and takes lots of grinds even on strong setting, buy better"
Connie Cowell,1.0,"March 9, 2013","Total garbage, I bought it because Consumer Reports gave it a high rating despite being affordable, but hated it.  Even brand new, it never got the water hot enough to make good coffee.  The coffee it made had that sawdust flavor you get in an old coffee maker with a poorly functioning element.  Back to the chemex, even if it means the coffee isn't waiting for me upon arising in the morning."
Amazon Customer,5.0,"August 28, 2016",Works well
Wilkins,2.0,"November 9, 2013","This coffee maker worked great for the first 4 months. Unfortunately it no longer heats the water hot enough. This shouldn't be a problem if you enjoy really weak room temperature coffee. I have tried adding more grounds and using the ""strong"" setting, but it makes no difference.  I am pretty disappointed since it was a nice coffee pot before it stopped working correctly."

And the company sent it to me in August. I am so done with these people. I even asked the rep if I should send it back, thinking they might want to check into the problem, but she said throw it out. That even upset me more.  Has anyone else had this problem? The auto timer never clicked on and the manual button doesn't do anything. So I don't know what the problem is."
Nmarincel,5.0,"February 7, 2017",Working great! Makes delicious coffee!
Romance Junkie,1.0,"June 28, 2014","I hate this coffee maker.  The internal design is weird. To fill, the lid hinges up from the right side.  If your left handed it is uncomfortable to fill.  The filter basket can float. I accidentally had two filters in one morning and ended up with coffee and grounds EVERYWHERE. The coffee didn't flow properly thru the second filter so it all backed up, floated the filter basket up so water and grounds went everywhere.  In the water reservoir, in the carafe,  on the counter, on the burner.  I had to disconnect the unit and rinse everything out.  Argh.  The last Mr Coffee maker I had was infinitely better than this one. The lid hinged from the back to fill from the left or right and the basket seated so it couldn't move.Also, the LED lights on this one are super bright. Maybe too bright. They light up your kitchen at night."
Darius Davenport,2.0,"September 22, 2014","Am going to buy another brand as the arm that delivers the water to the filter has started to ""dribble"" the water and catches the edge of the filter and it falls in creating a mess and weak coffee with grounds in it. Not a happy camper in the morning when I need that first cup!"
Mr. Super,4.0,"October 7, 2014","Good product, good programing options, best for right handed people."
Joseph Jones,5.0,"January 3, 2014","Easy to use, makes great coffee, great price. What more could you ask for? A must buy for coffee lovers especially if you dont want to spend $100+ to get a coffee maker of equal value."

KSV,2.0,"March 19, 2016",I purchased this coffee maker exactly one year ago. It quit pumping water 2 days ago.  I used it everyday.
Sarah Fischer,2.0,"April 30, 2016","Worked great for 6 months and now it releases about a 1/2 cup of water onto the counter with each brewing cycle.  Maybe coffee makers just don't have long lifespans, but I was definitely not pleased with how quickly this one crapped out."
Nick,1.0,"December 24, 2013",I did some research as to one of the better coffee makers. I saw this one had a ton of good reviews. I bought it. I wish I hadn't. It burns the coffee. I've had this for a few months. I thought it might have been the water I was using. I went out and bought a Britta filter. Made no difference. The water comes too hot down I think. I miss my old coffee maker that burnt out.Pro: CheapCon: You get what you pay for
Le,4.0,"February 28, 2016",Our second purchase of this unit.  Certainly not the best buta modest cost.  We add creamers.  There are better choicesfor the just black drinkers that are willing to pay more.
cabanaboy2011,2.0,"June 25, 2013",I received one of these models as a wedding gift. It worked exactly 6 months to the day of using it. I have sent Mr. Coffee an email to see if it can be repaired/replaced. It's a shame as I was very pleased with the coffee maker but depending on the outcome with the customer service department it may be the last Mr. Coffee purchased for my home. Everything seems fine with the control panel and buttons but it does not draw up the water to brew the coffee. I'm guessing the pump has stopped working.
Christina Reyes,3.0,"January 30, 2015","It's very nice. However,  it does have an overwhelming plastic smell. I cleaned it out by brewing water and a few tablespoons of white vinegar and the coffe does not taste like plastic! It brews fast and keeps the coffee super hot."
Unhappy Buyer,2.0,"December 9, 2011","I purchased this coffee maker. (Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT).  First thing I noticed when I set it up was the strong plastic smell...and figured it would go away.  On the second day I used it, my husband & I kept hearing this popping & crackling sound after the coffee was finished brewing and realized it was the coffee maker.  It sounded like plastic expanding & contracting.  We checked the coffee maker & the plastic sides were hot and the glass pot was so hot I burned my fingers on it.  We immediately unplugged it and I returned it to the store for a different brand.  I realize Mr. Coffee is a good brand and this was probably just a fluke...but, it sure scared me!!!!"
waha,1.0,"October 12, 2014","Bought a Mr Coffee in May; it died by the end of Sept. When it worked, it was very slow. This was the 3rd Mr Coffee we've tried in as many years. No more; these are no longer like the Mr Coffees of the previous decade. Junk."
James R. Jones,1.0,"October 25, 2016","Has already quit working. Warmer plate will not come on after making coffee, The clock has condensation on the glass so you can not set the time or see what time it is. Purchased  on here 9-9-16. Will not get a Mr. Coffee again."
Aneta Downey,1.0,"September 28, 2011","I have owned several Mr. Coffee machines but this one is probably the last one I buy.  The design is unbelievably poor.  There is a filter over the basket that touches the paper filter and causes the paper filter to fold over thus pouring grounds into the carafe.  If you are very careful, the filter can be positioned so the grounds do not spill.  Not my strong suite first thing in the morning.  The carafe might as well be a dribble cup since the contents always spill regardless of how careful you are.  Does not matter whether you are filling the reservoir with water or pouring your first or your last cup of coffee.  It will spill. When placing the carafe on the hot plate, if the carafe is not consciously pushed to the back it will hang up on the bottom of the basket and coffee will spill on the plate and countertop.  If you want to sneak a cup before brewing is done, coffee pours onto the hot plate.  It does not shut off as advertised.  I have had the machine 3 months and not one time have I used the machine without some kind of problem.  Most commonly dribbling."

Matthew MacLean,1.0,"July 10, 2015","This started out as a great coffee maker, but after 4 months it started leaking out the bottom. It soaks a sponge on the counter each time I brew a pot. Couldn't return to store because it was past 60 days. Very disappointed"

Shinninator,4.0,"March 11, 2016",I've used this over a year now. Picked up on a lightning deal for $20 bucks so it was a great buy. I never had an issue of plastic smell. I enjoy the coffee it makes and would recommend this product. The reason it only gets 4 stars is because it has a loading beeping when the coffee is ready. I HATE it because I wake up early and sometimes it wakes my wife and/or baby.
LKSB,1.0,"April 16, 2016",Bought this when new baby was born early June 2015 for parents visit since they are avid coffee drinkers. Well the thing now takes 45 MINUTES to brew a single pot of coffee. Ridiculous!
James,5.0,"September 9, 2014",Perfect for my wife and I. We set the coffee grinds every night and the coffeemaker start making coffee at the time we set it up to.

Coffeehead,1.0,"December 14, 2011","Before I start I want to be clear that I am going to try to be as objective as possible and that this review will focus only on my experience with this product and nothing more.We bought this coffee maker and set it up on our kitchen counter. I went through the instructions, set the timer, and brewed 10 cups of coffee using a standard fine roast. We had no issues whatsoever for 3 weeks. One fine morning, I came downstairs and noticed that the clock was blank and that the on/off button simply did not work.I unplugged the coffee maker numerous times hoping it would reset, but nothing. I went back over the instructions, nothing. So ended our short relationship with our Mr. Coffee.

Tim,5.0,"May 25, 2013","Makes excellent tasting coffee in just a few minutes.  Be sure to ""brew"" 12 cups using just water to eliminate any plastic taste. This coffee maker also looks great on the counter with its contemporary design with a black and chrome exterior. I highly recommend."

Robert Boitt,2.0,"November 15, 2013",This machine worked great for 6 months then nothing.....didnt even turn on.Seems steam from the coffee maker gets into the display electronics and shorts it out.PS...this is the second one. My first the heater blew out.Buyer beware
Linda,1.0,"October 7, 2011","Please note that these are issues for me personally such as cord, height etc.* Very messy--from filling water reservoir to removing pot for pouring.* Short power cord- maybe 16""'s (No tape measurer, I'm sorry)* Clock is not backlit--unable to read time* Opens left to right instead of front to back. Would not be so bad if cord was longer and you had more options to move away from cabinet or whatever you are placing your pot next to. I know this sounds confusing..... In other words, minimum space to the right of it, not good for me since cabinet is there. Once again, short cord makes this a problem for me.* Very tall-I have high cabinets from counter (once again no tape measurer....) it fits under cabinet fine however, you can not open lid all the way.* Slow brewing* Filtration filter has to be put exactly on filter basket, or will fall in* Water window on right side only.  Hard to see.  I fill resevoir directly from sink with hose. Unable to do this because, once again, the short cord makes it unable to turn sideways to see window.*When removing pot. It has a hesitation where it is getting caught on the pour n serve.  I know it is supposed to have a little resistance but this one has too much.I did not have a problem with a plastic odor and I never found the coffee to be medium or ""luke warm""POSITIVES-  Great color (That's it......literally!!)Hope this helps....................."

We were fed up with our last coffee maker because it failed to make anything hotter than luke warm coffee. We have had several Mr. Coffee coffee makers over the years, some produced great coffee, others were less impressive. After shopping at our local department store and scanning Amazon reviews we settled on this coffee maker. It has several nice features including a water filter, brew strength adjustments (regular or strong), delay brew, and an optional metal carafe (reduces the number of cups per brew to 8, but keeps the coffee hotter longer). Best of all it produces hot coffee, hotter than any other machine in its price range (that I have tried, and I have tried a lot). Overall it makes good coffee and is probably the highest quality coffee maker in its price range. If you are a true coffee aficionado then you will want to spring for a more upscale coffee maker (look at the Cuisinarts), but for the average coffee drinker this machine works great!"

It didn't become noticeable with mine until after I had made a couple of pots. The smell and taste transfer to the coffee and make it absolutely rancid. It looks like some other people were able to get rid of this horrible taste and smell by running water/vinegar/baking soda through it multiple times. I don't have that kind of patience, so I just went to Sears and got a percolator made out of stainless steel parts! Don't buy this thing."

You can use 12 cup glass carafe or 8 cup thermal carafe (purchased separately - but cheap enough).  Makes great coffee and with the 12 cup - keeps it hot for 2 hours before shutting off automatically.  All the features of the really expensive ones for less than half the price and does a great job.

I threw the box away, so God knows if they'll take it back, but I don't appreciate the waste of my time to return it. If I sound crabby, I am.

This one drips coffee unless you pour it very slowly. The coffee grinds dirty the bottom of the filter and leave it greasy. It has a swinging arm over the top of the basket and I am afraid one of these times I will forget to swing it back into place. There isn't a light on the clock unless it just isn't working. I am not satisfied with this coffee maker at all and would love to get my old model if it were available.

Old Duffer,1.0,"January 3, 2016","I purchased this coffee maker, hedging my bet that I would get one of the ""good"" ones.  If you look at the customer reviews, 20% of them comment on a very strong chemical smell emanating from the plastic of this otherwise, really great and well priced coffee maker.  This coffee maker has rave reviews from those who did not get one with all that nasty chemical smell, both on Amazon and at other sites on the web.  One customer review I read suggested perhaps the units were made at different locations.  Hence the evidence that some of these coffee makers are fine and others have that horrible chemical smell, which by the way, I could not get rid of.  Coffee brewed through the coffee maker after cleaning it with vinegar and running several complete cycles of clean water through it still smelled and tasted of whatever chemical is infused into the plastic.  So, I rolled the dice hoping to get one of these that didn't have the chemicals, and lost.  The coffee maker itself is a really good unit.  But, if you get one where the plastic.(and all of the working parts through which water used to make coffee passes, are plastic) is infused with whatever chemical is causing the smell, then I doubt anyone would want it.  Sending this back to Amazon whose customer service is kind enough to accept a return."
Kindle Customer,1.0,"April 22, 2016","I purchased this coffee maker from a local retailer, but my experience has been so bad that I thought I would review it here too in the efforts to help anyone looking for a decent coffee maker that lasts.What sold me on this one was that it removes chlorine from the water - we have horribly chlorinated drinking water here and I wanted that.  I also liked the programmable feature and the sleek look of the coffee pot.It's easy enough to set up and use.  Unfortunately, as with most products these days outsourced to China - this coffee maker was not made to be quality.  I would expect a 40 dollar coffee maker to last more than six months before completely giving up.  It was starting to leak almost immediately - first just a few drops under the maker, then within a few months, a little puddle underneath it every time we made coffee.I am so sick of products that were once good declining in quality and never price.  We had a Mr. Coffee maker before this that lasted a few years.  the last two now have had issues so I am all done with this brand and will seek out something more durable with the same features."
Linda,2.0,"April 13, 2016","I received a Mr. Coffee coffee maker 30 years ago at my wedding shower I had it for about 15 years. I broke the pot or it was updated to a model with bells and whistles, but the point is, it used to make HOT coffee and it was reliable.  I don't question the quality of Mr. Coffee, so when I purchased this one I thought the price was great and was confident it would make coffee for some time to come. Not so.  After less than two years the water completely leaks out of the reservoir.  I am not talking about it going over the basket (there is a handy little gadget that makes it near impossible to do that), I'm talking about the reservoir itself.  When I first bought it, I scoffed at the suggestion of a ""service plan"" thinking, these things last forever!  You have to sneak them out of the house when hubby isn't looking just to get something a little more modern looking.  The jokes on me as it seems it was built to break"
Andra,2.0,"February 5, 2019","Okay, so my old coffeepot gave up after about 2 years of use, so I needed a new one. Read a bunch of reviews, tried to be a responsible consumer. I saw the bad reviews but most were from 2+ years ago so I thought heck, they must have changed the design/addressed these problems since then.I'm pretty appalled. I unboxed it, looked great. Cleaned out the inside and the carafe with some dish soap, everything was fine until I actually turned it on. It worked okay for about 2 cups, I walked away and not three minutes later I hear loud sizzling in my kitchen. I run back in and see the coffeepot spewing coffee all over my counter, the coffee is boiling so hard on the warming plate that it's actually rattling the carafe. Queue me cleaning up coffee, turned it off, looked inside to see if anything was out of place. Nope- looked good. So I turned it back on to try to determine what was going wrong. I look at the connection between the top of the carafe and the spring loaded spout thing, and coffee is actually bypassing the spout and going down the inside of the coffee maker, right onto the hot plate the carafe sits on. I play around with position for a little bit and finally realize the trick is to pull the carafe out towards you as far as you can without pulling it off of the warming plate itself. Good grief.I leave the kitchen to let it finish brewing. A sharp beep from the coffee pot indicated it was ready, and lo and behold I get to the coffee pot and the ENTIRE FRONT PANEL OF ELECTRONICS is fogged up with steam. This is such garbage design- there's literally nowhere the steam can escape so it comes out of the carafe itself, right into the panel with the clock, buttons, you know, THE THINGS THAT SHOULD NOT BE EXPOSED TO WATER.What an absolute joke. Never again will I buy a Mr Coffee product. Save your money and don't let the sheer volume of reviews on this one fool you. It did all of this ON THE FIRST DAY.So I said screw it and just bought a French press. You can't win em all, kids. One star because it actually made my coffee, which is good."
KitKat,3.0,"December 10, 2016","Good coffee pot for every day but I found two flaws. First let me tell you that I purchased this coffee pot in October of 2015. The first few brewing cycles it smelled a little found inside but I didn't find it to change the flavor of my coffee. After maybe 3 or 4 cycles it was already gone. So when you open it don't be alarmed. There's nothing wrong with it. Brew your coffee a few times and you'll get over it.Some ""perks:"" it brews quickly, coffee is very hot which is great (once you add cold milk it's still tasty hot coffee), extremely easy to use, looks great on the counter and is programmable. I use it every day and it takes a beating and it's holding up marvelously. The directions on the bags of coffee I have and the water tank are pretty accurate. You may want to adjust how much coffee grounds you are going to use depending on the strength you want but it doesn't take much to figure out and that's with any coffee and coffee pot anyway.Flaws: It shuts off after two hours. You have no control over that. I'd like it to be three hours because I drink my coffee slowly and not everyone in my house wakes up at the same time but whatever. Secondly, it gets VERY dirty- inside the water tank, the basket and inside the area around the basket all gets a coffee buildup of some sort. It's disgusting. I have to clean it often inside. Lastly and MOST IMPORTANTLY, after doing a cleaning today I found wires sticking out from underneath the rim where the water drips through into the coffee pot. If the wires were to break I could have a fire I think. Therefore, until I get a new coffee pot in a few days, I won't be using this anymore because I'm too scared for my safety. I took a video but I can't figure out how to post it.Recap: keep it if you don't see wires sticking out of yours. Otherwise, skip it and buy something else!"
BeefyJay,2.0,"January 4, 2018","It's a pretty straightforward, regular coffee maker (except the ""on"" button doesn't say ""on,"" it says ""select/off""). It didn't last very long, though, before it simply stopped working. I've had it for about two year and used it about half of those days. So, don't expect it to last a heck of a long time, I guess they just don't make them like they used to.The flat water filter it uses is a joke. Water can't hardly pass through it, so it usually just spill over the sides of the disc and into the grounds. I replaced it once and the new one did the same thing, so I just tossed it altogether (I have well water, so I don't really have a need for it anyway).Also, the clock is slightly fast on it. If you want it to match the other clocks on your kitchen appliances (and be accurate) then you'll have to adjust it every couple of months.I'm going with a similarly-priced coffee maker with similar capabilities for the same price; I don't want to buy another Mr. Coffee product that might not last more than two years."

Music junkie,1.0,"May 21, 2016","I bought this based on the positive reviews.  However, my experience has been entirely negative -- If I could, I'd give this thing zero stars.  The product looks as pictured and it certainly looks nice on my counter. But that's the only good thing I can say for this model.  For starters, it's overly complicated to use:-  Filling it requires pulling the unit to the edge of counter as the cover is very tall and can't open under any cabinets.-  Water filling area is small - so don't miss (which is pretty easy to do).-  You have to get both the basket and the water filter situated JUST RIGHT >> If you use the water filter disk, the water just pours down the middle, leaving the edges of the grounds semi dry and not brewed correctly.  So I'm wasting a ton of money in extra grounds.  If you DON'T use the water filter disk, the coffee filter falls in on itself and much of the grounds end up either clogging the ""pause and pour"" stopper or the grounds end up in the carafe.  Huge design flaw, IMO.-  Plus, the dang thing leaks water (tried making a smaller pot 3 days ago. . ..  about 3/4 cup of plain water was under the unit.  ""superduper""  >:-(  At first, I thought I may have ""missed"" when filling the water reservoir - but I was very watchful the next day (confirmed no misses on my part) but it still leaked.I tried to return it, but I can't it's over the 30 day limit (I've used it less than 20 times but I should have opened the box and started using it right away.  My bad.).  Live and learn.I'll never buy another one of these again.  So disappointed in this product.  Grrrrr...."
Jess W. Dixon,4.0,"September 5, 2016","We like it.  I just get a little weary of wiping out the large accumulation of water in pockets and moisture under the lid when it's time to clean up, empty the grounds. I use three paper towels to mop up all the water and moisture when I lift the lid.But my most irritating little, and it's hardly worth mentioning, is that I need to wipe the pour spout of the carafe after pouring each  cup full.  It leaves coffee moisture which turns to stain quickly in the pour lip.  I know, it's no biggie, and I am far too sensitive over little irritations like this.  Yes, it is hardly worth mentioning here......so why bring it up at all?  I don't know except it just irritates me.  But so does the cat when she vomits on the garage floor!  Sorry.It makes great coffee as a ""Mr."" should, right?  Wipe down with a couple of paper towels - or three if you're a fuss-budget like me, and leave the  lid open and it eventually dries out totally.Forget my fuming, just buy it.  I bet you'll be happy you did."
Chrstian Roberts,1.0,"July 25, 2016","Good coffeemaker. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!The coffeemaker itself does exactly what's advertised. That is, ours did so until it stopped brewing one day. Just up and died at the ripe old age of 8 months.Which is fine, sometimes things break, that's why there is a warranty. And that's where I ran into difficulty.I very clearly said the words, ""I am calling for warranty service"" when the agent came on the line. I explained that the coffeemaker wasn't brewing coffee.I was asked to look at the prongs on the power cord - the ones that go into the wall and get scratched up as the unit gets plugged in and unplugged, if it does, and ours does - and then read the letters on the prongs to the agent in order to make sure we're still in warranty. Well, the letters on the prongs were all scratched up, and what I was reading wasn't what the agent wanted to hear. This is getting dumb already. I got put on hold for several minutes as punishment for not providing the right letters.So we finally managed to get past that point and agree that I was in fact covered under warranty because I'd only bought the thing 8 months before. I was then informed that they would register my warranty but only give me 4 more months of protection. Well, obviously...I only expected 4 more months as I had had the thing for 8 months thus far and I knew when I bought it that the warranty period was 12 months. Why are they telling me this? I asked why I was being told this, and I was informed that I had called to register the warranty.No.No, that is not what I said.The exact words I said were, ""I am calling for warranty service"" and I also said the coffemaker wasn't brewing.At this point the agent wanted to argue with me, saying that they ""document all calls"" and the notes they had written thus far said that I had said I was ""calling to register a warranty.""Oh, my goodness. Now I am getting impatient. *So* not what I said. This person isn't even listening.This is getting ludicrous. I never said the word ""register,"" I never call to register warranties. It's not necessary. I just keep the receipt and if I need service within the warranty period, *then* I call and I'm ready to show proof of when I bought the item. ANYWAY...so then I got put on hold for several more minutes as punishment, again.So we manage to get past THAT, because I indicated that even if I *had* said I was calling to register the warranty - which was NOT what I said - either way the coffeemaker is not brewing coffee. Not a drop. We clean it every month with vinegar like we are supposed to, and I need it fixed or a replacement or whatever it is we do in this situation. I got put on hold again for several minutes, as punishment. I use this time to contemplate my sins.FINALLY the agent takes my address and informs me a new machine is on its way and I can throw away the old one.What should have taken five minutes took over half an hour.The only reason I even want another of the same machine is because I bought extra water filtration discs and I have no way to know what else they might fit.My next coffee maker will be a d@mn Black and Decker. I had no idea they even made kitchen stuff, until I went shopping for a hand mixer one day and I found a Black and Decker hand mixer. Its all black and chrome and shiny and it lives in a MANLY black case and it does an awesome job and ithas lasted for years. And it's MANLY.Black and Decker from now on.Mark my words.MANLY(after all this, I need to check my blood presssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss"
destryer,3.0,"April 4, 2016","The coffee maker itself works as well as the previous 8 year old Mr Coffee it replaced that died. The inside has fill levels for glass or metal carafes which is nice for using unmarked containers to fill but you must be looking directly down into the fill chamber. The water arm swings clear making filling easier to hit the opening than my previous top fill. The water arm takes a little practice to make sure it is in the correct place for brewing.My  complaints are that the previous model had a lighted analog style clock that was a nightlight and easy to read and the new maker's clock is not lighted and deeply recessed, while surrounded with shiny chrome making the clock almost useless to see due to glare. It's a little annoyance but I use the clock a lot. I also don't think it was mentioned that the clock is unlit in the product description either. I also purchased the stainless carafe and the coffee maker senses whether you put in the 12 cup glass or 8 cup metal carafe and turns off the bottom heater for metal. The entire lid has to swing open to one side to fill so you cannot fill it under a low upper cabinet without pulling it out."
BRIDEOFHYDE,5.0,"October 18, 2019","Recently, I've noticed that quite a few things I ordered from Amazon years ago are still working and still in use. I ordered this coffee maker from Amazon in 2012. It's now 2019 and I still use it. I wanted something sleek and shiny. In this price range , it's one of the coolest looking coffee makers and looks good on my counter.It has an extra little water filter because clean water makes better coffee. It's programmable, which is a good feature at this price point.I'm still happy with it and I'll continue to use it until it falls apart."
Warren,5.0,"April 22, 2015","I was cautious about buying a $30 coffee maker but all the reviews seemed to say this was a decent coffee maker. I have to say they were right! This coffee maker makes excellent coffee! I like the strength setting which my old $100 coffee maker didn't even have. It looks decent but the buttons feel a little cheap. But most importantly, it makes great coffee and looks good on the countertop. Unfortunately because this makes great tasting smooth coffee, I now drink more!***Update***I am not sure if this a bad design or not, but every now an then the coffee maker stops working, maybe once a year, but it turns on but it doesn't brew. In order to fix and not buy a new coffee maker, you need to simply replace the fuse underneath the coffee maker. Just take the bottom cover off and you'll find 2 small silver fuses in series (there are 2 for safety) Take your meter and see which one is bad, or just replace both. They are super cheap on amazon. It's a super easy fix with your soldering iron and it extends the life of a great coffee maker!"
Cushman Ken,3.0,"November 26, 2014","I did a lot of research before purchasing a drip coffee maker, it is rated very high by Consumer Reports. I was surprised that nearly every brand had a significant number of Amazon 1-star ratings, including this one. Most of the complaints on this model involved a plastic taste in the coffee. I cleaned the coffee maker per the manufactures instructions with plain water, then a brew with white vinegar.  Then made a couple full  pots of coffee with some old decaf I rarely use. Finally I brewed a pot with Starbucks french roast and I can say it made excellent coffee, no plastic taste and very hot! The jury is out on how long the maker will last!Update 11/27/2014: Changed the star rating from 5 to 3-stars! I experienced the plastic taste some of the reviewers have commented about. What I have discovered is if I prepare the coffee the night before, and the water sits in the coffee maker reservoir over night, the coffee has a plastic taste when brewed in the morning. If I pour the water in the reservoir just before brewing, I don't experience the plastic taste. When opening the lid to the reservoir the plastic smell is very strong, I am hoping this will go away in time?"
S. Forbes,3.0,"August 21, 2015","Updating this review 4/11/17:This coffee maker was a 4-5 star coffee maker, right up until the day it just stopped working. It's roughly two years old at this point, and should still work. I bought a Mr. Coffee, because I am of the mindset that it is a quality coffee maker. I was hoping to get 5-10 years of use out of it before replacing, so imagine my surprise when without warning, it just stopped working.  I'm waiting on my replacement which we ordered two days ago (yes, another Mr. Coffee--because I foolishly bought a 5-10 year supply of the charcoal disk type water filters for this machine, thinking, optimistically I'd get a lot of use out of this coffee maker). If this machine dies a premature death, I'm going to go back to a Krups, or perhaps a Braun.Much in the way Maytag used to be a name associated with quality, I had a similar mindset about Mr. Coffee--now my faith in the brand is, shall we say, LACKING.CAVEAT EMPTOR.(Original Review, 2015)When it was time to give my old Krups its funeral, I was glad I bought this to replace it. Sleek. Programmable. User friendly. Easy to clean. Produces a great pot of coffee. Great value for all these bells and whistles. Now *if only* the machine would load ITSELF! with the coffee grinds and water the night before--then I'd be in heaven:)"
Brian W. Ewert,5.0,"June 26, 2016","At one point I had 3 different coffee makers on my counter at the same time trying to find a decent one. Our last coffee maker was an Oster. It was great but after a while one of the hoses under the heat plate would blow off ever few weeks and it got really annoying. We have a Mr. Coffee in our locker room that never fails, always works likes it's supposed to, so I figured I try this one. LOVE IT.No problems with any of the negatives other people have brought up other than the display. It is pretty much worthless :( I miss the cool blue light emanating from the Oster. Unless you're 3 ft tall you can't read it and even then when I scroutch down I have to have my magnifiers on to see the numbers. However, that's not why I bought the coffee maker. I bought it to dependably and repeatedly make great coffee - and that it does!!"
Lord Knows,5.0,"May 25, 2018","You are not going to believe this, but this amazing product makes real actual coffee.  YES!! Hard to believe, I know it.  But you put thecoffee filter in the top, then the  coffee grounds in the filter, see, and then you put the water in the cup thingie in the back, and then you hit the button and then the coffee comes out.  Oops, remember to put the carafe in first, because if you don't it has nowhere to go and it will well up and spill everywhere.  But that's not the coffee maker's fault if you do that, that's your not being awake yet.  Someday in the future they will perfect getting the coffee to you before it's made so that you will be awake enough to put the carafe in but for now, you have to just remember.  If you're really that bad, just make a big note."
J. LeMaster,3.0,"November 19, 2014","I've had this coffee maker for several years, and now I'm looking for a better one.It takes a very long time to brew. I use standard coffee grounds, but the water drips onto the grounds slowly, and even then the basket fills up and sometimes takes up to twenty minutes to drain into the pot. I've taken the coffee maker apart and cleaned out the tubing, so I know it's not clogged.I've tried it with the permanent filter, with a paper filter, with the permanent filter on top of a paper filter, and with a paper filter inside the permanent filter, but to no avail. It still takes a very long time.Also, the coffee maker doesn't evenly saturate the grounds, so I often feel compelled to open the cover and stir the coffee while it's steeping (instead of draining). That's a pain that I shouldn't have to do. Coffee DOES taste better when I do this.I also wish someone could explain to me what the button for ""Strong"" or ""Normal"" actually does. Does the water get hotter? Does the water drip more slowly? What does that setting do that affects how strong the coffee is?Without a backlight on the clock, it's practically worthless as it can't be read unless very very close.I suspect that once I find a new coffee maker, Goodwill shall be the recipient of this one."
Evelyn D. Roberts,5.0,"September 1, 2016","We are quite happy with this coffeemaker that we have now been using for a month.I noticed many complaints about the clock not being visible, and that is a fact, it is indeed difficult to see with no backlight.  We don't really care, we don't need another clock in the kitchen.We don't use the program to have the coffee turn on, I make our coffee the night before and when one of us awaken in the morning, we simply turn it on.  We get up whenever we please, and it will automagically shut off 2 hours later!  THAT part we really appreciate!  :)We use the Strong brew, the coffee is always nice and HOT - we always had to zap our coffee from our other coffeemakers, as it was never quite HOT enough to please either one of us.There is no ""plastic smell OR taste!"" as is mentioned in several reviews.  I don't use the 'water filter' because I fill it from my Brita pitcher.There is no ""leaking"" and there is also no way the cover can be closed and have the 'coffee run all over the place' because the spout wasn't over the coffee grounds!  There is an arm in the cover that will push the spout over the coffee grounds."
Amazon Customer,2.0,"April 19, 2016","I'm Mixed on my opinion of this machine.  It's a great coffee maker....until it dies.  I've had 2 die on me.  One within the 30 day return period, this last one died yesterday after about 5 months...outside of amazon's return period.  The heating element goes bad, causing the maker to not be able to heat water, thus the maker is useless.  I would love to love this machine, but TWO of them dying of same problem within 5 months is REDICULOUS.  I have a replacement one that's been going for a month....well see how long that one makes it.  Horrible reliability issues with these pots.  If you only want the coffee make for a month or so...buy away, but don't expect it to last.  I wish amazon would look into this and remove this product from its site."
J Stahl,1.0,"May 19, 2016","This product arrived on time but dead as a door nail.  Called Mr. Coffee and they are sending a replacement in 2-3 business days.  So sometime next week.  I got this Mr. Coffee coffee maker with my Amazon Prime account with two day delivery.  Two days yes.  Also two days and not working.  No offer of compensation.Update:  New coffee maker arrived today, only one day,  but it is broke also.  Plastic around hot plate cracked.  Mr. Coffee sending another new unit but this time a JWX-31.  They are sending it next day.  Received new maker today(5/24/16) in good working order.  Followed instructions on cleaning and took water temps while cleaning.  Brew temp was 183.2F and finished coffee(12 cup with pot off hot plate) 179.9.  First pot of coffee tasted good and was hot.  Took some time to get a working coffee maker so the one star stays.  Mr. Coffee service reps were polite and able to get a coffee maker to me that works though, not the model I ordered.  The JWX-31 is less attractive but appears to function  the same (water in coffee out).  The JWX-31 has a cleaning cycle that the SJX-33 does not have.  At this point I can not recommend Mr. Coffee coffee makers.  To much hassle for a sub $50 item."
D Stabler,2.0,"April 13, 2016","The heating element of this design will burn out very easily if you use it a lot, and we do make a lot of hot beverages in my home, so we've had the support team on the phone at least three times already replacing this unit for the same design issue.  Apparently, though there is nothing in the manual to tell you this, you shouldn't ""turn the system back on"" when it times out to keep the carafe or pot warm.  This causes the element to overheat over time... about 90-120 days, and the whole unit stops working when that happens.  As the warming system has a max of two hours time at a fixed temp you're stuck reheating in a microwave if you don't use up your brew the first pass.  We strongly suggest a rewrite of their manual to advise AGAINST restarting the warming tray, or a redesign to avoid whatever element failure is happening that breaks the whole thing.  When it works, it's great.  When it stops... it takes two to three weeks to get it replaced unless you just want to buy a new one."
Real Person,3.0,"June 16, 2014","Got this to replace an old old Mr. Coffee that came with my house when I moved in. That old simple one made the BEST coffee!But it shorted out one day..... disaster.  So I bought this one, and after ""breaking it in"" by running a few cycles with no coffee, it is up to the level of the old one.  My secret for GREAT coffee?  I NEVER WASH the basket or the pot. HA! You may think this is weird or funny...... but the coffee oils accumulate, and give your coffee the best flavor. I just rinse the pot - no soap..before I fill it, ...and rinse the coffee basket once in a while. No soap!  You WANT those oils to enrich your next pot. I make a new pot every day, so nothing is left to get funky.  Like someone else here mentioned, I just pour a cup separately and reheat it in the microwave. I don't let it sit on the warmer too long. Try my favorite coffee - French Market Medium Roast. Use 10 cups water to 1 scoop ( I use a scoop from the Whey Protein Powder ) - it's a full shot-glass size scoop. Or a jigger-and-a-half, if you have one of those. That makes some mighty fine java, my friend!  Be sure to seat the coffee basket CORRECTLY - it's a little tricky. I find that the ""tab"" should be facing 1 O'clock. And make sure the basket is seated by testing with a push. Before you turn on the machine!The one time I didn't seat it correctly, it didn't allow the water to enter the coffee pot, and made a mess with the grounds and water overflowing inside. But that was MY mistake.  Also, I lift the access lid before the pot gets full, to let all the steam that has condensed back into the water chamber. There IS a lot of condensation. No big deal.  Makes great coffee!Note- I am amending my review - after using the coffee maker for 3 years, the basket spring is not working, and the coffee overflows and leaks all over the counter, creating a real mess. I guess they just don't make things the way they used to. Buying a different brand.Really, it was nice while it lasted, but I would expect it to last longer than this."
Shadow fax,5.0,"December 28, 2014","I've been using a Keurig for a few years, and after wasting money on what their company calls ""A perfectly fresh brewed cup of coffee"", ( by the way I've owned two in the past thanks to the good old folks at QVC) and after many uses, I noticed that the water reservoir didn't completely fill my cup as with other Keurig coffee makers. I read Consumer Reports on different coffee models, and Mr. Coffee was highly recommended. I also browsed  through Amazon's customer ratings (some not so great due to burnt smell complaints of said coffee maker) on this particular model. I've not had one problem with the plastic burnt smell. I suppose if it's brand new I did notice a slight smell, and ran my water & vinegar through a couple of test cycles. This morning, I made my first pot, and it was great! No more half-filled cups of coffee  frustration. No more running to the store to buy expensive coffee pods. And I didn't have any issues with coffee spillage! Just measure water precisely and it does the job! And great for the price. Instructions was clear and concise. I personally recommend that glass pot be thoroughly washed daily after use and I believe that this last me for a long time Not bad for a single grandma (stroke survivor) who likes just one cup in the mornings. I will definitely recommend this coffee maker. Thank you Amazon! As always, you delivered well on your products!"
Anch999,4.0,"May 6, 2020",Coffee pot did not work out of the box. Took me a little while to realise that the tube that goes from the pump to the filter was not connected. It was just laying loose in the back of the water tank.  Once I connected it the pot worked perfectly. I like the way the pot looks and it is easy to use however the way the water tank is set up it will be difficult to clean. I wish it had either a removable water tank or one with a larger opening.
"Dan F., WI",5.0,"October 18, 2013","I love my coffee, but I'm not one to plop down $100 or more for our morning brew, and I like to make it by the potful, not the cupful. Over the last 40+ years I've gone through a lot of coffee makers, and this is the first one ever to impress me at so reasonable a price. No wonder it was one of the top rated machines in 2011 and considered a ""Best Buy"".First I need to say that if you want a TRUE 12-cup coffee maker, this isn't it. The standard for a ""cup"" of coffee has been 6 oz. for as long as I can remember (and that goes back to when we made our coffee in percolators). Every other 12-cup machine makes 72oz of coffee (12x6 = 72). This 12-cup makes 60 oz. So by redefining the size of a cup of coffee to be 5 oz., they call it a 12-cup coffee maker. Sorry, but it makes only 10. I'm OK with that because I never make more than that anyway, but you should be aware that 12 will get you 10 in this case. Now, on to the review ...The machine is handsome to look at in black with chrome trim and highlights, and is easy to wipe clean. It is very easy to fill (with a clear water-level window) with a generously sized opening so you don't spill water outside the machine (I've had one with which I had to use a funnel to insure that I didn't spill water all over my counter top). The controls are intuitive, easy to use, and brightly lit LEDs indicate the settings. While the LCD clock is not backlit, it is easily seen from most angles.There are two brew settings: ""regular"" and ""strong"". The strong setting just releases the heated water at a slower rate so it filters through the ground coffee more slowly but, of course, it adds to the brew time. Either setting can be used with the automatic timer. The LED indicator lights are bright to let you easily confirm your settings.The machine can be used with either the standard glass pot or the optional carafe. While the glass pot holds 60 oz. of coffee, the carafe holds only 40 (or just over 6 ""standard"" cups). The coffee maker automatically detects whther you are using the glass pot or the carafe, a nice touch.Another small but nice feature is that when brewing is finished, the machine gives 3 soft but easy to hear beeps that the coffee is done. The pot stays heated for 2-hours, after which time it automatically shuts off, again sounding the same 3 beeps. Of course, you can hit the ""on"" button again to keep the coffee hot, but you will quickly hear another 3 beeps (as when the coffee was first done).After 2 weeks of use, I have gotten nothing but consistently good coffee, pot after pot using"
TXJL,2.0,"June 22, 2018",I'm pretty annoyed that this coffee maker quit working this morning. It lasted less than 2.5 years with almost daily use. I'm glad I didn't invest in the thermal carafe option. I'm glad I kept my old Mr. Coffee maker so I was still able to make coffee this morning. I also never really liked the water reservoir design on this model. It's completely square so water spills out when filling it from the carafe. I'm just really disappointed in the short life span of this model. The one is a basic 12 cup programmable model given to me in 2006 from a friend who'd had it for while before that so it's well over 12 years old and still works. But this model didn't even make it 2.5 years.
Bruce,2.0,"April 26, 2016","Bought this for heating water to make tea as I drink about 3 pots a day. This seemed like a better solution than the tea kettles. Note that only R.O water is ever used in it.I do agree that it is messy when opening lid as it drops condensation which gets around past the stopper and onto the burner or falls outside the sides, but I keep a towel handy to wipe up when refilling.I like that it allows for a hotter brew and rely on the 2 hour time-out and gentle reminder if I need to restart.The problem lies with build quality.I had my unit for 6 months and it stopped brewing. I read the reviews and see this quite common. As an engineer and ex-electrician I decided to look into the problem as I did not have time to do without while shipping it for warranty repairs. First thing I noticed was that as I opened the bottom that there was a rattle coming from a loose internal screw. Looked around and could not verify where it was from so I chalk it up to a bonus they provided, kind of like when you find a bug in your food and consider it free extra protein.I was concerned that the electronics may be bad but that was not the case as I heard the relay click when trying to start it. A little probing with the power off and using a multi-meter showed that one of the thermal cutout fuses was open. Seeing no potential damage, as well as the fact that the second fuse was still intact, meaning that it was more likely a bad fuse than an actual over temperature condition, I did some research and found replacement fuses (at Amazon), although I did have to buy five and only needed one. After a 2-day prime shipment, and cutting out the old and crimping in the new with trimmed down stak-on lugs and the pot is fully operational again. Also note that there are many you-tube videos to help if you have basic repair capabilities and weigh the risk that this is a safety item.So 2 stars is what it gets for good features but bad manufacturing. There is no way a consumer item should have such a short MTBF."
Loren B. Ford,1.0,"June 27, 2015","I purchased this Mr. Coffee coffee maker while on a trip to the States from Costa Rica where I live, and where some of the best coffee in the world is grown. After following Mr. Coffee instructions to run a couple of pots of only water through the machine, the first few pots that I brewed came out fine. However, soon my wife and I started noticing a terrible chemical plastic taste in the coffee. I had read that others who had purchased the same model Mr. Coffee coffee maker had encountered the same problem if terrible tasting coffee, but unfortunately didn't heed these negative ratings, given many other positive ratings. It's hard to believe that anybody would find this plastic-tasting coffee to be acceptable, so I have to conclude that Mr. Coffee purchases its plastic raw materials from various providers in China, where just about everything sold by Amazon is made. So it appears that you take a gamble buying products made in China. I can't return the coffee maker to Amazon for reimbursement because I had had it delivered to a family member's apartment in Chicago where my wife and I were visiting, and Amazon's product return software will only print a return label for UPS with the original address listed as the return address. UPS in Costa Rica will only honor a return shipping label if the return address (i.e. the address to where the originally purchased product was delivered) printed on the label is in Costa Rica. To have Amazon ship a product to Costa Rica involves paying for import and custom services that make the shipping cost more than the item, which is why we buy stuff while visiting in the States to ship back. That essentially makes the Amazon purchase return guarantee worthless."
Noé,5.0,"February 21, 2015","I originally read about this model in consumer reports as their recommended buy, and boy did they get that right, this is the second one I've bought in a year. The first one I bought ended up staying at my father's place when I visited last summer because he loved it, so I needed a replacement at home, and in all honesty you can't beat the price or functionality of this bad boy. The simple chrome accents give it a modern look, and it gives you enough bells and whistles like the delayed start timer, auto-off, strength of brew, fresh timer...that I'm not really sure why you would pay more for a standard brewing device. One thing to note is the first one I bought would beep as soon as the coffee starting brewing, my newer purchase beeps when the coffee is done. I'm not sure which one is working properly, but in all honesty I don't care because the coffee is consistent and good.With my first purchase I bought the Mr Coffee reusable filter and it works great, I will be buying another one for my second purchase once I use up the disposable filters I have left from an old roommate. I will definitely be recommending this to anyone looking for a standard coffee brewer."
Amazonian1998,3.0,"July 16, 2014","=== Update: 31 July, 2015 ===The unit stopped working today. It made it a year and a half of daily use for 1 brew cycle.I'm sick to death of appliances that won't last and our throwaway culture. I don't want to buy 16 different coffee makers over the next 10 years. I want one.=======================It's a pretty good unit for the price point. I am dismayed at how ridiculously expensive decent coffee makers have gotten, and this was the best one I could find for a reasonable price that didn't have abysmal reviews.Cons:- The carafe sits too close to the top of the drip area, resulting in major condensation above the carafe so when you remove said carafe, it results in drips all over the hotplate.- The ""strong"" brew choice seems to not work at all. If I set it onto strong, the unit runs for about 30 seconds then apparently thinks it's finished and switches off. It's not a total deal breaker for me though because the coffee on the regular setting turns out just fine.- Didn't include a metal filter, which I had to purchase separately for $10.Pros:- Thoughtfully designed. The spray head swings out of the way to access the brew basket, and the lid has a piece that will automatically push the spray head back into place when you close it so you don't have to worry about forgetting to re-position the spray head.- Good quality carafe- Hotplate / burner is teflon coated allowing very easy cleanup- Auto brew timer so you can have coffee ready when you wake up- Very reasonable price- Classic drip brew style! I can't stand the ""brew stations"" and all that nonsense that has been so popular lately and seem to be pushing classic drip brewers out of the market."
S.D.,2.0,"November 29, 2019","I’ve had this machine for three years. That seems to be the lifetime of this thing. I’ve had to repair it three times. It overheats and the “Strong” setting automatically shuts down after 30 seconds and won’t stay on. I’ve had to replace a hose. Fully cleaning it is a chore (if you think me merely washing the carafe is enough, this approach will catch up with you eventually in the form of weaker coffee and clogged bits). It’s currently clogged again and I’ll have to replace it. The coffee was of average quality and strength."
GeekGal,1.0,"June 28, 2016","I've purchased this unit THREE TIMES in the last year and a half, although only once from Amazon, and it is a P.O.S. I am rarely this harsh, even in a negative review, but I've been using this brand of coffeemaker for years, since 1980, in fact, and never had I had such a bad experience with any Mr. Coffee model as I have with this one. This coffeemaker, the newest of which I purchased in November of 2015, is sitting on my counter top this morning, and is now nothing but a clicking digital clock. An attractive digital clock, but that's all it is as of 7 am today. AGAIN.Each time one of them has failed, it has been the same thing. I have set it up to make coffee, and all it does it click. The water won't heat, the carafe plate doesn't heat, and of course, no hot water, no coffee. It was working gangbusters the day before, so the failure each time has been without warning. Since this is my THIRD copy of this coffee maker, I'm thinking it's the model. I'm very disappointed. DON'T get this one."
South Dakota Shopper,5.0,"December 9, 2014","I can see why this coffee maker received the Consumer Reports best-buy award three years in a row.  It is easy to use and delivers great tasting coffee.  Make sure to run a couple cycles with water only to get the ""burnt plastic"" process out of the way, which seems to happen with every coffee maker out there (no matter if you spend $20 or $200).  Water seems to be hotter during the brew cycle than past coffee makers we've had, which seems to affect the flavor of the coffee.  With our more expensive coffee, a better flavor results, but with our normal day to day coffee, Folgers, the hotter water tends to being out more of a bitter flavor of the coffee.  We are still playing around with the amount of coffee used.There is the possibility to use a thermal carafe that we probably won't need.  Most of the time we turn off the appliance after the brew cycle is complete.  But, if we forget, the appliance has an auto shut off after 2 hours, which seems to keep a good pot of brewed coffee from burning.We thought about getting a Kerig appliance but have too many coffee drinkers in the house to justify the cost. Our household uses the 12 cup carafe per day. Kerig's carafe is an 8-cuper (40 oz; in coffee maker language 5 oz = 1 cup, not sure why).  Perhaps we will get a Kerig one-cup coffee maker to use on those rare times just one adult is in the house or for those times non-coffee hot drinks are made."
Cellar,5.0,"August 21, 2015","Gets the job done. For the price it has lasted more than a year and I use it once a day maybe sometimes twice per day.May perhaps upgrade to something more high tech in the future. Low maintenance, not much to clean out and the coffee comes out decently hot.You need to let the pot sit however so that the heating unit below the pot brews the coffee hotter. I usually am okay with it straight from it's fresh from filtration. I don't think it needs to be scolding hot. Leaves the coffee at a perfect temperature.My ONLY complaint, which is not at any fault of this product what soever is that I wish I had something easier to brew in the morning. Setting up the filter and adding the water and such when your still sleep walking makes this a small task in the morning (Not in a bad way, but if your a super lazy person who is super grouchy in the morning, I would want a coffee maker that just does what it does at a certain time and when you wake up viola.This machine, you need to have a coffee grinder and such. By no means a complaint, just the extent of my laziness and a comment made for those who are this kind of person in the morning. Get a super high end one if you hate the set up. If you don't mind it, this gets 10/10"
Simplyme,4.0,"March 4, 2015","I like this machine, and for the most part I do recommend the machine. I remember when I first received it that I was absolutely happy to have it as my old machine was giving out on me and I gave it a run. The pre-setting is awesome and easy to use. I love that it has a stronger or regular selection for the brew strength... I have yet to use the metal carafe, as I only have a glass carafe..I do like this machine, however. after a few months this Mr.Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT  is starting to do what my old coffee machine was doing of why it was replaced....  It just has not gotten as bad (yet) as the old one.The machine is to have a pause mechanism for when you are brewing a pot of coffee, it pauses and you may sneak a cup. I have to have this, with being a coffee addict and my inability to wait for the pot to be fully brewed :)  ... At the moment it does it once in a while, and usually it is not pouring out like my old machine used to, but I am sure over time it will, as that is how things go, and nothing lasts forever. I have cleaned the machine, and that some times helps with this but some times does not.Over all I give a 4 star review because it is wonderful machine, and the pause feature works most of the time but just some times it is faulty; which can be annoying but it is not flowing out, and it started after a lot of uses as well..I believe this was great purchase!"
G. Parker,5.0,"July 26, 2012","This new coffeemaker replaced a 5 year old (still working) Mr Coffee with the same features as this one, but what an improvement! The old one had a lower base and you had to tip the carafe forward to slide it back on the warmer area - this one is easy to slide - it goes in straight so you do not drip coffee during the process. The carafe spout does not dribble like the other did while pouring (and after).  The bright lights are easy to see at a distance to tell you what it is doing (or off) and the brew countdown is also a plus. The warmer keeps the coffee HOT until the full 2 hours are up.  Also, having the control area high (above the carafe) means no accidental bumping of time or other buttons because it is in the way on the counter. It is compact and neat looking. Overall I consider this a great product.I did notice a slight plastic smell and the first several times I used it that lingered a bit. I did as suggested by many and ran a white vinegar cleansing cycle and that helped resolve it. I have not used the filter (nice addition) yet because we are used to coffee made with our local water, and the replacment filters seem hard to find and expensive. I also had a bit of a time with measuring the grounds (I use preground dark roasts) for the right flavor. I used the chart in the owner manual and that is no good for our tastes. I ended up measuring exactly as I had been doing in the old Mr Coffee and that worked. The one thing I noticed is when you pour in water to the 10 line, when the coffee is brewed, it is nearer to 8 1/2 line in the carafe. And you do have to pull the maker out from under a cabinet to fill it, but I had to do that with the old one as well. That is not an inconvenience to me.I would recommend this to anyone who is used to Mr Coffee products. I have had bad luck with other brands so I did not even look at them this time. Most had lasted less than a year, but my Mr Coffee was still working after 5 years, and I hope this one will do the same. It is early still, but so far so good!"
Joseph J. Brophy,3.0,"December 19, 2013","This is my third Mr. Coffee. I gave the first one to my daughter about ten years ago because the white was so stained by coffee fumes that it always looks dirty. It still works. The second one I just replaced had a thermal carafe (a 95 model) with a crappy top that eventually stopped working and could not be replaced so I had to get a new unit. The old one made good coffee but the carafe didn't keep the coffee hot. I read a bunch of reviews before buying this one because I like my coffee. The more expensive ones did not seem to justify the extra money. This one works well enough, but it does have that weird plastic smell. I thought it would go away after awhle but ten or so brews along it's still there.The coffee seems to have an off taste - maybe it's my imagination.  I will try the vinegar treatment but this is something the manufacturer should not let out of the factory. When you take off the carafe to pour the first cup, a few drops of coffee always get on the heater plate and sizzle away. The glass carafe seems flimsy. I expect it to break some time soon. The heater burns the coffee in less time than it takes for me to drink it all so I pour it in a real thermos carafe which works much better than the Mr. Coffee one. I don't use the program function so I think I am going back to the old Chemex or Mellita my wife always teased me about . PS- I didn't go back to the Melitta and Chemex is too expensive. After three years of service, the carafe was okay but the water reservoir started leaking so I replaced it with a non-programmable model.  The old stained one I gave my daughter is still going strong."
Blackbeered,2.0,"January 28, 2016","I'm a coffee drinker.  I usually go through two full pots a day.  I like my coffee strong ... I use 66 gms of finely-ground 100% Columbian per 12-cup pot.  I use the gold-plated filter from pots gone by; I use filtered water from the fridge in addition to the filter that comes with it [which I'll eventually toss and not replace].Bottom line ... this product makes a decent cup, at least to my liking.Seems like I'm replacing my Mr Coffee every 2-3 years.  Usually I don't have anything to say, but this time I have to .... I don't like the fact that the unit doesn't ""remember"" you like ""strong"" ... you've got to press it for every pot.While I'm at it, the brew is quick [initially] at 5minutes for a 12-cup pot; the hot plate maintains 170F [about 20 degree cooler than I like so I always have to nuke by mug for 30 secs after adding milk]."
H Kingbomb,2.0,"October 8, 2015","I purchased this in April 2015 and today it stopped working.  The lights came on and it started to brew, but stopped after only a few tablespoons brewed.  I tried restarting it, and the brew cycle would not continue.  The warming plate was also not hot.  During the 6 months that it worked, I have no real complaints other than the fact that the clock is not backlit on this model, which I really miss from our last one.  We owned the previous model for about 9 YEARS before it failed.  Mr. Coffee clearly is not making the same quality products these days.  I am going to see what my options are with the 1-year warranty.  Hopefully I do not have to pay for shipping, but if I do, I will not bother repairing it and will never purchase another Mr. Coffee product again.UPDATE 5/21/17: I received a replacement machine at no cost, which has worked fine until today.  We have the same issue!  The lights turn on when I try to start the brewing cycle, but nothing brews and the warming plate doesn't heat up.  Very disappointed as we are no longer under warranty.  I guess you get what you pay for, and this is a cheap coffee maker."
Robert Karma,3.0,"August 26, 2013","I ordered this item to replace my aging Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker I had been using for several years. Since I was very satisfied with that Mr. Coffee I looked for the current Mr. Coffee item that was closest to the one I had. This item had the same features and I felt confident it would be a worthy replacement. On the positive side it works well in brewing the coffee. The coffee is hot from the first minute it is brewed up until it shuts off. You can use the timer to have it brew your coffee at the desired hour. It will shut itself off after two hours. The negative aspect so far has been it persistently drips when you remove the carafe to pour our coffee. I have learned to pull it back a little to get it to drip for @ 15-20 seconds and that helps most of the time. When I try to take it out before it has finished brewing it will drip unlike my previous model. The carafe itself looks and feels less sturdy and less well-made as my previous model. It flexes when I clean it and I am pretty nervous about how fragile it feels when it is full of scalding hot coffee. also you cannot adjust the heat level. It gets annoying that I have to constantly clean the hot plate due to the dripping but it is functional enough to where I will put up with it until it fails and needs to be replaced. So like so many things in life, it isn't great but it isn't terrible... it is just tolerable."
GearJunkie,5.0,"July 3, 2016","I've owned and used this coffee maker almost daily for 2 years.  I purchased the thermal coffee pot, and all together this coffee maker does a wonderful job brewing hot coffee.  You can brew immediately, or set the clock and automatically brew at a certain time.  I've never really liked setting up coffee the night before, so I have mine set up so that I can wake up, fill it with coffee grounds and hot water, and then get ready for work, and there is a hot pot of coffee waiting for me when I'm ready to head out the door.I really like that you can change the brew setting for normal or a stronger brew.  The stronger brew seems about perfect for me, and I'm really picky about my morning coffee.  It is easy to clean, I just run some vinegar through it from time to time, and wash and rinse the basket and pot after each use.  This is a coffee brewer for someone who drinks coffee...not the watered down nonsense you get from a Keurig."
Casey M,4.0,"May 22, 2016","Overall I've been pretty happy with this coffee maker. I've been using it daily for about 4 months now, not too many complaintsPros:-The user interface is reliable, consistent, and simple to figure out-Programmed coffee brewing works great-Relatively fast brewing time-Heating plate keeps coffee at a nice hot temperature-Comes with a replaceable water filter-The machine has a nice appearance, looks good in a kitchen with stainless steel appliancesCons:-I can't notice any difference between the regular and strong brew settings-The machine sometimes has trouble stopping the coffee drip if the carafe is taken out in the middle of brewing, which causes some coffee residue to get stuck to the heating plateOverall I've been very happy with the machine. I think that for the low price, the machine has gone above my expectations. I would recommend this to the average coffee drinker."
Lynne Vermillion,3.0,"March 9, 2014","I bought this coffee pot because it was highly rated by Consumer Reports but I'm very disappointed in it.  About the only good things I can say about it is that it makes coffee and the timer works.  These are my objections to it:1.  The coffee is not hot.  The first cup is usually okay but subsequent cups are just warm.  I  reheat them in the microwave.2.  It only comes with the chrome front and black top and sides.  I don't like chrome fixtures (too hard to keep clean) and would have preferred white.3.  The brew now and delayed brew are controlled by the same button.  Press once for brew now and twice for delayed.  These should have been separate controls.4.  The water filter is a separate disc that sits on top of the coffee grounds area.  Although it seems to do the job it was designed for, it is awkward to have to move and relocate this for each pot of coffee.  My previous coffee pot (Cuisinart) had the filter located on the water line and only had to be moved to change the filter.5.  The 12-cup claim is based on a tiny 6-oz cup.  The glass pot actually contains more like 7-9 regular size cups and the thermal carafe holds even less.I can usually rely on Consumer Report recommendations, but this time they really let me down. I'd recommend just buying a simple coffee pot with a timer instead of this one."
johnny,5.0,"February 23, 2015","Really nice basic coffee maker.  We've had a number of coffee makers - different kinds of dispensers/carafes, ones that have hot water functions, Keurigs, espresso machines, etc., but this basic one has been our favorite.We've had it for a few months, so to comment on some of the reviews I saw before purchasing:-- It doesn't leak-- It's impossible to misplace the carafe-- Don't have any kind of basket overflow issues-- Programmable clock works just fine - not intended to be a bright clock like on a microwave-- No issues with filling with water - use the carafe, it's easier to not miss-- Programming is really simpleNo complaints!"
R. Maurer,4.0,"February 3, 2015","Had to replace a late, lamented Black and Decker DCM-2500 SmartBrew. (Other, newer Black and Decker models have not lived up to this one, and why they've changed the design is beyond me.) Went for the Hamilton Beach 46201 first, based on the reviews, and I don't understand why people seem to love that pot. They must like lukewarm coffee.I returned that mistake and went for this one - now THAT's more like it! Hot from cup 1 (and as you should know, the temperature of the hot water hitting the grounds is VERY important - this pot gets it right). Brews a cup every bit as good as my old B&D.Now, is it perfect? No. The carafe is light as a feather - handle it with care. The inside of the brewing area never seems to rid itself of condensation - it collects in several spots, which you can either dry out with paper towel, or just tip the machine backward to drain. And, yes, the plastic smell you've read about is there, but for me it was gone after 2 or 3 brews, and it NEVER flavored the coffee. And aesthetically, the shiny, fake chrome look is kinda cheap and annoying (but not as annoying as having to potentially pay an extra $15 for the all-black version, so I'll live with it). A backlight on the clock would be nice, too. And the Fresh Brew Timer is useless - it starts from the beginning of the brew cycle, but it should start, IMO, at the END of the brew cycle after the 3 beeps (their way, your coffee is already ""12 minutes old"" right after a full pot brews).All minor issues, as far as I'm concerned. Hot, uniformly-brewed coffee, cheap pot, it's a winner!"
gretch1,2.0,"July 4, 2013","The first time I used this, the clock display steamed up so it couldn't be read.  It dried out by the next day, so I didn't think it was that big a deal.  However, since then, the condensation has built up so much that the clock cannot be read at all.  Luckily, I always do my delayed brew at 6:00 a.m., so I don't have to change it.  But if I ever do have to change it, there will be no way to set it for the right time again.  And if I ever have to unplug it for any reason, I'll be out of luck.The Start/Off button does NOT turn the unit off.  Luckily, since I am using the glass decanter, it shuts off automatically in two hours.  And luckily, I have not had the need to brew another pot before it shuts off, since you are supposed to turn it off to do that.  If I ever really have to turn it off before it shuts off, I would have to unplug it, which would suck, since I would never be able to reset the clock because of the above problem.I also do not like how you have to fill it.  Trying to pour water from the glass decanter into that small fill area is not easy, and the water always spills out around the machine, and some goes through the filter area and down into the burner.  I always have to wipe up a lot of spilled water every time I fill it.  I liked my old coffee maker that had a removable reservoir you could fill at the sink...no pouring.And finally, there is always a lot of sediment at the bottom of every pot.  I use the proper measurements, and am using the gold tone permanent filter which I ordered with it.  I don't even use the strong setting very often.  I don't know why I'm getting that sediment, but I can never drink the whole pot to the bottom because of it.I thought the pot would be okay after using it for a week or so, and I discarded the box and all the packing materials, so now I can't return it.  Very unhappy with this pot, but will have to live with it as I'm not going to rush out and spend more money on a new one."
LY,3.0,"March 8, 2015","Very visually appealing. It's easy to stick in the ""coffee corner"" of my kitchen. I don't use this that often, but others in my house do and like it for a big pot of coffee brewed and ready pretty quickly. It's good for when  you need coffee for fuel and less for flavor. You're not gonna get nuanced ""berry"" and ""chocolate"" notes out of the coffee you put in this thing.The initial plastic taste is incredibly overwhelming for... a while, but it eventually goes away/lessens. We've had this for a few months, use it 1-3 days per week.The plastic basket for the coffee grinds is also weirdly designed. It has to be placed in exactly *so*, or else it doesn't go down fully and brew correctly. We had a few overflows and figured it out quickly. But jeez, just make it so the basket can get plopped in, not so one nub is precisely at 1 pm. Is it the biggest deal? No, but if you're one of those folks that wants coffee quickly, well, you don't expect  to have to clean up your whole counter."
Sandra L. Mahan,4.0,"May 23, 2020","I had one that lasted years and made the best coffee. When it stopped working, I had to get a replacement. Since I had to wait almost a week for it to be delivered, I bought the only coffee maker the store had. It leaked coffee grounds all over. Took it back and got a refund. Though it took two days longer to be delivered from what Amazon said, I was happy to get it.  Now I can have good coffee again."
NEguy,4.0,"January 15, 2012","I've had this for about 10 days.  It's taken a few cycles to ""dial in"" the right amount of water and coffee, but it seems to be working fine.  At the risk of duplicating many of the other reviews, here goes:Pros:- coffee is hot- programmable- no problems pouring coffee - I pour slowly anyway- water level side viewing windowCons:- no clock back light (consistent reviewer complaint).  Fortunately, the programmable time is the same for me each day, so I never look at the clock once it's programmed.- problems with coffee filter collapse if I don't use the water filter.  I have well water, so I filter anyway and I have no chlorine.  I may try to use the filter insert without the filter.  Having to put the filter unit in each time is one more thing to remember/clean/find/break.- I like the strong coffee setting, which, according to the manual, is ""sticky"" across brewing cycles (apparently resets if you press the button or unplug the machine).  However, mine resets after every brewing cycle.  Not happy - one more thing to remember. [UPDATE] CS rep says the setting should be sticky.  I'm looking to verify the feature with another owner before proceeding with warranty process.- Could have done a better job on the manual.  Some steps are poorly written and I'm surprised that they never discuss moving the spray arm back and forth during setup and cleaning.  I wonder if some people forget and the spray arm ends up sending some/all of its water back into the reservoir. [UPDATE] I've learned from other reviews that the arm moves back into position when you close the cover.  See, it pays to read the reviews!Is anyone else surprised that this model is NOT listed in Mr. Coffee's web site?  I wonder what that means.I'll update in a month or so if there is anything new to report."
Showtime,1.0,"November 22, 2016","Purchased in Feb, 2015, unit stopped working in early November, 2016 - lights would turn on, but it would never brew.  I went through the stand troubleshooting steps:  carafe properly seated, basket properly seated, reservoir clear and filled with water, etc.  I even went to the trouble of removing the bottom to ensure the hoses and valve were not clogged. I have not yet gone to the next step - checking or replacing the diodes/fuses to see if that will fix it.  Not sure if that is worth my effort given this is a relatively cheap unit.I contacted (via chat) Mr. Coffee (i.e. Jarden) customer service to inquire what other troubleshooting steps they could recommend (e.g. send me a service manual).  I also wanted to see if they'd be willing to have some circumstantial understanding (i.e. I was not the cause of the defect) and go above and beyond their stated 1-year warranty (which is essentially not a warranty).  After three different chat attempts with three different chat reps, I was offered a 10% ""loyalty"" (hysterical) to buy a new unit.  All of the reps were rude.  I specifically asked if they would rather I never buy Mr. Coffee products ever again and was essentially told they couldn't care less."
Bud P,5.0,"October 3, 2012","Our coffee maker died.  We were in a panic as we tried to find a good replacement fast.  Then my wife whipped out a copy of Consumer Reports.  In it was a review of the Mr. Coffee SHx33GT.  The gist of the review was that this coffee maker out performed or equaled the taste and features of coffee makers two to three times the price.So, of course, we ran to the computer and got on Amazon.  We were very curious regarding the customer reviews that complained of a 'bad' or 'plastic' smell and taste and the hard to poor carafe.  But we put our trust in Consumer Reports and the positive reviews and ordered ours, ($40 free shipping).  We got it in less than a week.I am happy to report that either the people that gave negative reviews were wrong, or maybe Mr. Coffee changed something since they bought theirs.  I unpacked the coffee maker, ran one cycle of water through it, (no vinegar), and in 5 minutes I was drinking the best coffee I've had for a long while.  And I tried to make the carafe drip as I poured it and could not get a drip.  In fact with the design of the rim and the shape of the glass, it is way better than our old Mr. Coffee maker which not only dripped but had plastic around the rim that harbored coffee which dripped a muddy looking mess on the counter and floor.We are super happy with this coffee maker and I think the coffee tastes better than any I've had from other drip type makers.  It doesn't quite make it to the quality of a percolator, (for those of you that are too young to remember, that is a coffee pot that continually cycles the water turned coffee through the grounds until it is the strength you want), but it's very close.All in all, a great coffee maker in a compact size that is super easy to use which produces great coffee.  For $40 I don't see how you can beat that."
PricklyPear,5.0,"February 3, 2016","Sometimes I get up in the morning to the smell of freshly brewed coffee wafting throughout the house...to find several family members standing in front of this coffeemaker, waiting impatiently to receive it's sable brown goodness. They playfully fight to see who gets the first cup.I believe the coffee maker is as responsible for good coffee as the coffee itself. This unit is not one of the most upscale we've owned (we've had Kitchenaid and Cuisinart in the past), but it is very good at making a great cup of coffee. You can set it for the richness of brew strength; it is programmable and has an auto shutoff (so can be set to brew your coffee first thing in the morning and be ready for you when you get up); and is generally a really useful machine that can be purchased at a reasonable price."
Tiberius Roof,1.0,"January 19, 2014","I hoped, reading the reviews, that this coffee-maker would reflect the reviews of the more satisfied customers.  It didn't.  Instead, it seems to possess a limitless reserve of Plastic Taste somewhere.  You put in water, add some beans, set to brew, and hey presto, blech.  We tried cleaning it, running water through it several times, and a vinegar-water blend that some people recommended to clean it out, and all our efforts accomplished precisely zip.  The coffee continued to taste like it'd been brewed in an old tire.This utterly abysmal coffee-maker came on the back of two dead Mr. Coffee coffee-makers in a little over two years, and after three strikes, convinced us that it was time to switch -- in our case, to an electric kettle and a French Press (Proctor Silex and Bodum Brazil).  And in that regard, this coffee maker worked out beautifully -- no coffee-maker I've ever owned has brewed such delicious coffee as that French Press makes.Thanks, Mr. Coffee!"
Pam McBride,2.0,"September 7, 2016","We have had our maker for 2 years. This morning my wife made our last cup of coffee in this maker.  I tried to make a pot and the lights were on but no brewing. I went though the trouble shooting list, all good, still no coffee. I called the service # and they say that the coffee makers is old. 2 years lady's and gentlemen, that is how long they make them to last. We live in a throw away world, very sad. I hope we can find a manufacture of coffee makers whom is not in full GREED mode and will make a machine to be proud of; at least one that will last more then 2 years. I did take machine apart to see if a wire is loss or one came disconnected, all looked good. I could image that they put a small breaker in the line that dies after so many uses. We wonder why we live in a world full of plastic garbage. It starts out plastic garbage."
Stephanie P.,4.0,"July 23, 2013","I consider myself a bit of a coffee gourmand. I have an espresso machine and a french press, and then there's the easy, lazy drip maker. Ours died so we bought this. The reviews were great and it had a ""strong"" option which I thought would be awesome because my favorite bean is Starbucks Espresso Blend. I like it strong! Anyway, it was a good price with good reviews and I'd say all in all it does what it needs to do, make lazy coffee. I didn't really notice a difference in the strength of the coffee with both the regular or strong brew options. We bought a gold tone filter, also, because I like all the extra oils and sediment from the coffee beans similar to the french press. When we put it on the strong brew option it tends to overflow but I also use a half a cup of coffee for a full pot so...My other coffee maker didn't ever overflow, though. I love that it beeps at you when it's done brewing but I suggest leaving the pot in the maker for a few more minutes because it drips which means I'm not pulling the coffee pot out mid-brew. I don't know if they all do that or just mine but I never drink mid-brew so it's not a huge deal and I don't mind. I just turn the burner off and let it sit for two or three minutes until most of the dripping is done. All in all I'd say it's a pretty good coffee maker. It's nice looking and it brews coffee when I want it."
MLee,3.0,"January 24, 2012","It takes only a few minutes to make coffee up to the 8-cup level, on the strong cycle.  After the first week, when there was a slight plastic aftertaste to the coffee, we've had no problems with the flavor.  A bit of experimentation is all it takes to get very good coffee from this coffeemaker.  We use about the same amount of coffee grounds that we used in our old machine.  The water filter is not a problem to use and is probably a good idea for any area that has hard water, like ours does.  The glass carafe only dribbles a little bit, which is easily dealt with by pouring the coffee out a little more slowly.  For the price, this is a very good coffeemaker.I have to amend this review.  It's 4 weeks after I wrote the above, and the coffeemaker stopped working one day last week.  We left it unplugged for a day, then tried using it again the following day, and we had no problem with it.  We don't know why it stopped working temporarily.  It makes very good coffee, but we now have some doubts about its reliability, especially as we don't know why it refused to make coffee one morning.Other reviewers have also mentioned that their coffee makers also died, but I wonder if instead they experienced the same temporary ""outage"" that we did.  We might have thrown the unit away if we hadn't thought to try using it again the next day.  We will continue using it and hope it doesn't get temperamental on us again.-----It's been a year since I wrote the review above.  We never had another glitch or ""outage"" and are still using this coffeemaker every morning.  It's still making excellent coffee.  After that one time, we never had another problem with it."
Larry B.,1.0,"February 4, 2016","I think Mr. Coffee has a production problem that they should really address.  We have hard water around here and so have to clean the coffee pots pretty regularly or buy new ones every few years.  My last 2 coffee makers have been Black n Decker's which made great tasting coffee.  The only reason we went with this maker is that it had a really good Consumer Report rating and thought we would give it a try.  We have had Mr. Coffee makers in the past and really never had a problem with them.  We received this maker and it had the problem of smelling and tasting funny.  I did everything, cleaned with white vinegar solution, hand wash as far as I could reach, changed water charcoal filter and even made coffee without the water charcoal filter.  After 2 weeks of struggling with this coffee maker, reached Mr. Coffee support.  They asked for the letters on the electric plug prongs and after reading them to her, they shipped me a replacement maker.  Received the replacement in 1 week and ran the maker through 5 cycles before making the 1st pot of coffee.  Had the same taste and smell as the 1st one all though not as strong.  We give up.  Going back to Black n Decker."
Teresa Cho,5.0,"April 28, 2014","I'm a college student and I have classes that start at 8 am every morning. I couldn't wake up earlier than usual to prepare coffee and I didn't want to spend almost 10 dollars a week on coffee so I went scouring through the web for a programmable coffee maker.Personally, I thought what I paid was a bit steep though it was on sale (I'm a college student, come on) but after using it for about five months its a godsend. I read horror reviews of cheaper coffee machines either leaking, making coffee taste like plastic (OMG CANCER), or even turning on randomly and becoming a fire risk. So after all these horrible reviews, I settled for something slightly more pricey but ultimately functional.It does exactly what it says and it doesn't look to shabby either. It has the excellent option of choosing a brew strength as well as programed time, it also gives a little bleep when it starts and bleeps when it shuts itself off after two hours. The only thing I would say that could make this machine better would be if they installed a glow function for the display cause COME ON GUYS, its 2014 and even watches at the dollar store have that function."
sothpaw 68,4.0,"March 18, 2014","I had the cousin to this coffee maker, same coffee maker just a different layout of the controls ,and it finally gave out. The plate the pot sits on cracked after 6 years of pretty heavy use.The coffee maker that I had previous to buying this one worked great and brewed an excellent cup of joe. Only gripes I have about this pot are that when you pour your cup of coffee it tends to want to run down the pot and on to the counter,which isn't a deal breaker but it is aggravating.If you pour extremely slow it doesn't do it at all.I like the fact that you can adjust the brew strength with this coffee maker that is one of the reasons I bought the same model again.I like my coffee pretty strong and I get that with this maker as I grind my own beans with a coffee grinder.I just prefer it over pre ground coffee.I gave this 4 stars because of the pouring issues with the carafe, other than that I've had good luck with this model,I clean it with vinegar about every 6 months and we have extremely hard water,but I use filtered water from the fridge when I make coffee, I highly recommend this model, if your looking for a coffee maker that will last,this would be a good choice."
CA Koi Friend,5.0,"June 12, 2014","I LOVE my new coffeemaker. It keeps coffee warmer (which I like) than my very old Mr. Coffee coffemaker that it replaced. The price was right at Amazon. It looks beautiful on the counter, and is a big improvement over my old one. The (Charcoal based) water filter is an added benefit. It does seem to make the coffee taste a little better with the chlorine removed.  I probably won't continue to use it and buy replacement filters when the month of use is over, however, as our water taste is good without filtration. The controls are easy and intuitive. It is a bonus to have a ""Strong"" option.  I am usually in to big a hurry to use it, and the coffee made the regular way tastes good. The only downside is that the water amount viewer is only on the right side due to the design. For me the left side view would have been better. It is a minor inconvenience to have to look around to that side for me, not enough to lower the rating.  The optional carafe is a bonus for any one who would want to purchase that."
Anon,3.0,"January 12, 2016","Ummm, bought this because of the ""best seller"" label, the reviews and the great price.  Am returning it.  It does make a decent cup of coffee and keeps it hot for 2 hours......no more than that, unless you reset it.  The plastic and the water spout are quite fragile and the water filter thingy is just too much of a pain if you use paper filters.  The LED clock screen is very dark.  We used a flashlight to set it and in the early hours of the morning, you certainly can not see the time.  The glass carafe is ok.  I prefer the ones with a plastic lip...less chance of breakage.  So mostly my experience is just ho hum.  I think you can probably do better in the same price range."
pctekki58,3.0,"June 10, 2016","We purchased this coffee maker last June.  It really does make great tasting coffee.  I like the programmable function which is easy to reset for weekend ""sleep in"" times and the brew strength selector, since my husband and I like a bold tasting coffee.Here's where the problems are.  The nonstick coating on the heating plate quickly wears off causing rust to form on it and this rust stains the bottom of the pot.  The biggest disappointment is it lasted less than one year before dying.  The electronics light up, but nothing happens.  No brewing, no heat.  It is very disappointing when one wakes up to a cold, unbrewed/empty coffee pot.  I previously owned Cuisinarts, each which lasted 5 years before dying.  Cost per year is MUCH less when spending a few extra bucks for the Cuisinart.  That's what I'm going back to!"
Malor,4.0,"November 29, 2013","This is a nice large coffeepot.  It's (mostly) designed well, and brews decent coffee.  It's just drip, so you're not going to be getting the quality you would out of a French press, but as drip machines go, it's quite competent.There's one very real design flaw in this unit, however: the handle on the pot is a deathtrap for your thumb.  The lid hinges in the handle, and the natural way to hold the pot while filling it is to tuck your thumb into the hole that appears when the lid swings back.Be very careful if you do this.  If the lid swings back down, it will trap your thumb.  Because the hinge is very close to the hole, the movement of the lid is compressed into a very short throw, so it's able to apply an extreme amount of force to your nail bed.  This is absolutely excruciating.I suspect there probably have been real torture devices that weren't as well-designed for inflicting pain as this coffeepot.As long as you're careful while filling the pot, it does a fine job.  But I don't give five stars to products that hurt me as much as this one did."
xDaddyWolfx,1.0,"December 9, 2015","We have only had this coffee maker for about two months and it just stopped working. It will not brew coffee at all. We've gone through all the troubleshooting tips, my husband has taken the thing completely apart and we have gone through the entire manual. We called Mr. Coffee to ask for help and they told us to call Amazon because that's who we bought it from. We called Amazon and they were going to charge us $18.68 to have it sent back in just so they could look at it and then charge us another $18.68 to have it shipped back to us!! That's almost as much as what we paid for it in the first place! I would not recommend this product to anyone! The product just stopped working and the customer service was horrible!"
EMFM,5.0,"February 25, 2015","My KitchenAid coffee maker broke on Easter morning. Clearly this was an emergency, and so I couldn't wait a day or two to receive a new coffee maker from amazon. I needed a new one NOW. I purchased this Mr. Coffee that day in a store, and absolutely love it. I have the glass carafe version. The coffee maker is easy to use and makes perfect coffee. I purchased another one in October (from amazon) when my aunt was in need of a new coffee maker. Her general complaint in life is that the coffee, no matter how hot, is not hot enough. This Mr. Coffee makes truly piping hot coffee - even hot enough for my finicky aunt. The only thing I would change, as others have mentioned, is that the clock is not illuminated. It should be. I was extremely disappointed that my KitchenAid died after about 3 years. I have high hopes that the Mr. Coffee will last longer. So far it's great, and I would highly recommend it."
Mike Mundy,1.0,"October 28, 2013","I ordered this unit specifically for the ability to program it to kick-on automatically, but due to cheap construction, I cannot. The LCD that shows the clock is NOT back-lit, so no matter what kind of lighting the coffeemaker is in, I simply cannot see it well enough to program/use. If I shine a flashlight directly on the LCD, I can make out the numbers enough to use, but that is ridiculous to have to do that when it may have cost all of 5-10 cents to backlight the screen. Also, their idea of placing a charcoal disk over the top of the filter basket to filter the water is absurd! I (used to) like Mr. Coffee, so the shoddy construction really caught me off-guard. Laying a round disk of charcoal on top of the filter basket is just so incredibly stupid, I am at a loss for words - did NO-ONE in this country see this crap before approving the design? I doubt it. And if this coffeemaker was built in the USA, then the engineering staff should be fired immediately! Never again will I waste my money on anything Mr. Coffee, I'll spend the extra bucks for a European design that can be used as intended. I expect this junk from China, not from us (the USA)!"
SkinCare,5.0,"April 14, 2014","Didn't experience problems that others have written about...beep when coffee is done is not loud at all - about 1/2 the volume level of a microwave beep, or quieter.  Pouring out of the pot is flawless - no running down the sides or even when pouring at a fast pace.  Filling the machine with water...some have complained that it is a small target to hit.  I say there is more than enough room to get the water in without spilling.  The water ""sprinkler head"" over the coffee grounds easily swings out of the way to remove the basket, then it automatically moves into position when the lid is closed - foolproof.  The glass pot can only sit in one spot on the warming plate, so there can't be any ""misalignment"" to create an over-flow situation.  Others also complained about an overwhelming chemical smell when they opened the box - I only smelled it when I put my nose on it.  I followed the directions for it's initial use and the first batch did have a ""new coffee maker smell/taste"", but it wasn't enough to discard it.  The second batch was much less noticeable, and the third was unnoticeable.I like that the lid opens to the side and it is easy to access the basket, refill with water and add grounds.  Programming clock and brew timer is straight-forward.  I wish the display was back-lit - it would make it much easier to check the clock and brew timer each night.  I don't use the included filter - not needed.  I like that the lid can be opened and you won't get sprayed with hot water/steam like some other designs. My initial experience has been very good."
Not on My Watch,3.0,"February 4, 2016","I give this 3 stars because I really want to like it. I really want this product to be good and reliable. However, after having the first one for a mere week (though it was probably only used 4 times), it decided it didnt want to make coffee anymore. The buttons were on and lit up, but the coffee maker did nothing. We couldnt find the source of the problem so I asked Amazon for a replacement. Thankfully, Amazon customer service is very good and they shipped me a replacement the next day. While I cant speak to the efficiency and dependability of the new one (as it has yet to come in), I am really hoping it is much better than this other one. I bought it for my office so it gets used daily, and it was truly a horrifying moment when we realized coffee wouldnt be made that day. It really looks very nice and has the aesthetics of a coffee maker twice as expensive, but I understand this might be a common problem with this model. I have a Cuisinart at home which works beautifully, so if this coffee maker does it again, Ill probably just invest in another Cuisinart for my office instead."
Leslie Dane Hanna,2.0,"June 17, 2014","For under $35.00, I can't complain a whole lot. It looks nice and feels fairly sturdy. It brews as well as any other low end coffee maker I have used. The settings are easy to use and I can easily set it to make coffee before I wake up.The major downfall of the coffee maker is that the filter overflows when brewing. This results in coffee grounds in the pot. This problem can be fixed by using fewer coffee grounds, but then you have to brew less coffee each time. I have tried multiple solutions to the problem with no satisfactory result. I have tried to weigh down the filter, thinking that the drip stopper was not fully compressed while brewing. However, it still drains to slowly and overflows. I have tried cleaning the product with vinegar with no change. I have used fewer coffee grounds, but this results in having to make smaller amounts of coffee.The problem I am having is not serious enough that I want to go through the trouble of returning it, but it is definitely a drawback. When it comes time to replace this one, I will be looking for another model or perhaps another brand. I understand that this might be a problem with the specific item I bought and may not be present on every coffee maker of this same model. However, I'm not testing multiple coffee makers. All I have to go on is the one I was sent."
A. Soduk,2.0,"February 13, 2017","This thing was great at first. The basket is big enough for a big load of grounds and it has a timer. It was a little slow, but I didn't mind it as I would set the timer and fill my to go cup on the way out the door. I kept up on cleaning it with vinegar regularly, but at about the 7 month mark it got REALLY slow to brew. So slow in fact that I would program it to start at 6:45AM and it would still be slowly brewing at 8AM as I was leaving the house. I cleaned it several times with vinegar, but it never sped up. I even took it apart, hoping to find a huge clog in the heating tube. It was completely clean and unobstructed! We used this thing daily for 10 months and with it going so slow, I'm considering it dead now."
Halka,1.0,"January 20, 2014","The machine looks nice enough and is relatively cheap, but like a lot of other reviewers, I feel like the coffee I'm making with this machine just isn't very good... in fact, it's terrible. Two main complaints:1. It seems to require quite a lot of grounds relative to the amount of water in the reservoir to make coffee that isn't completely see-through, even on the ""strong"" setting. Changing the fineness of the grind, brand of coffee seems to have no effect. I'm Mr. Coffee paper filters, and didn't want to invest in the cage filter because...2. There's a strong burnt plastic taste/smell in every pot even after 2 weeks of brewing, regular cleaning of the pot. Using filtered vs. tap water makes no difference. I wish I'd read more reviews (quite a few of which point out this issue) before I purchased this model.My frustration with this machine was bad enough that I decided to give up on drip altogether, bought a Bialetti Moka for the same price.. Apples to oranges, I know.. but it makes infinitely better coffee with only slightly more effort and grounds expended per brew. I'm only brewing for myself (gf drinks decaf) so the smaller capacity and lack of timer doesn't really bother me. The Moka also saves on counter space, still works when the power is out if you have a gas range :)"
David Nails,3.0,"October 20, 2016","Pretty decent coffee maker.It's fairly slow to get going, especially considering it replaced a Bunn with a reservoir. But the 'strong' button makes that part worth it.I don't like that it turns off after 2 hours. Some may say a pot of coffee is bad by then, but I don't agree. I'd be fine with another hour.It's also not convenient for on a counter with overhead cabinets. The top opens upward to fill the water, and it's so high you can't open it while under the cabinet. So you have to move it each time you want to fill it up.It also has these overflow holes in the back, which sit exactly at the fill line. The slightest bit over, and you've got a huge mess.I don't hate it, though if I had it to do again, I'd buy a different coffee maker."

Ward Palmer,5.0,"January 30, 2014","When it came time to retire my old coffee maker, I had a difficult decision to make because of the wide variety of machines available these days. I really love my coffee and was willing to go pricey, but in the end I thought, ""I'm not really a coffee snob and don't do the cappuccino-espresso-latte thing, so let's give Old Reliable a try."" Sure enough, the Mr. Coffee brews a great cup! Middle of the night, internet out, can't sleep... wonderful... The new coffee maker was set up and ready for its trial run. I hit the power, turned the strength setting to strong and waited. I started regretting the choice almost immediately because of the wait and thought of one of the machines that keeps the water hot and on hand. Then I remembered the timer and realized that this point would be moot if I had regular sleep patterns. Anyway... I poured the first cup, mixed it up to my taste and WOW!!! What flavor!!! I was so happy, I un-grumped and actually found the problem with my wiring at 3AM. Internet up! Day 2 just as good. Heading down to grab some more. Now I REALLY look forward to that first cup of the day! why would I need foofoo coffee when I can have this?! Update... Day 3 just as good..."
E. Long,5.0,"August 5, 2014",My wife was taken aback by color coordinated appliances. After some convincing and more shopping at Amazon the purple coffee maker she wanted became less important and succumbed to quality. This Mr. Coffee was the same price as the other and a much better value. The coffee comes out at a perfect temperature and has a regular and strong brew setting. It's programmable and shuts off after 2 hours which makes leftover coffee reusable for iced coffee or reheating without tasting old and burnt. A stainless carafe is also available which I highly recommend.  This coffeemaker recognizes either the glass or thermal carafe. The thermal carafe is 8 cup and the glass is 12 cup. The reservoir on the coffeemaker shows the water level for each and the burner automatically detects the carafe being used starting from the on position. Glad I shopped for quality and not succumbed to my wife's whim for color! I highly recommend this appliance to anyone who wants quality at a reasonable price.
tvlgds,5.0,"June 9, 2012","This coffee maker is one of the best I've owned, at least so far... I've only had it a few weeks. I've often said that if someone could make a carafe that doesn't drip all over the counter, they'd make a mint! Seems Mr. Coffee may have a winner. Even my expensive Kitchen Aid dripped all over---annoying and messy. I bought the thermal carafe and am pleased with that, as well. Love the option for ""STRONG"" brew, which was another feature that sold me---if I can see through my coffee, I'm not drinking it! I read the majority of reviews on this model, as well as several others and this one won out. If anything changes, I'll update, but it appears to be a great choice!Update 30Oct2016The first one started leaking water all over the counter after 4 1/2 yrs., so I bought a Brewmaster from a different company. Hated it and went ahead and ordered another of these since it has all the features  I want and was really a reliable machine that made great coffee. Despite some of the comments, I find the coffee piping hot even after adding half and half. Still love this model!"
GooseyGoo18,5.0,"March 8, 2013","My old Mr. Coffee coffee maker recently bit the dust and I read many reviews before my making my purchase. It came down to buying the same model I just had (Mr. Coffee LMX27 Coffee Maker, Stainless Steel) or getting this model. I read tons of reviews and ultimately decided on this one. My previous maker only lasted two years and it had started to leak from the bottom every time I brewed a pot of coffee. One of my friends has this one and I asked her about every complaint I read about and she has not had a single problem with hers so I took that chance and don't regret it one bit. This coffee maker is easy and makes piping hot, strong coffee every time!  I have not had a problem with it smelling (read about a lot of people have a gross plastic smell that wouldn't go away) nor have I had a problem with it not brewing properly. I use the delay timer and it's gone off every morning without a hitch. The only thing I wish this one had was a light on the clock like my old one did. Besides that, I am beyond pleased with my new purchase and would recommend this coffee maker to anyone!"
Chrystal Lee,5.0,"September 17, 2019","But first coffee, is my motto.  I am not a coffee connoisseur but I love my caffeine and I brew 8 cups with this every morning since I purchased it in May and it's been operating without any problems.

This gets the job done!"
Kris,2.0,"April 5, 2015","I bought this coffeemaker because it was highly rated by Consumer Reports. I read the reviews and noted the complaints of a plastic taste along with recommendations on how to get rid of the taste, so I figured I'd give it a shot. It's also worth noting that I'm not a coffee snob or super-taster.The first pot of coffee had such a bad plastic taste, it was undrinkable. Same with the second pot. And the third. So, I bought a huge jug of vinegar and ran 5 pots of a 50/50 water/vinegar solution through the machine followed by 5 pots of plain water. The taste was better (drinkable), but still tasted like plastic. So I ran 5 more pots of 50% vinegar followed by 5 pots of water. This time the difference was less noticeable--still tasted like plastic. Not good.I thought maybe time would take care of the last of the plastic taste or maybe I'd just get used to it. I used the coffee maker for a month--2 pots a day, every day. This morning I poured my first cup of coffee for the day and...blech!I give up. I've had my last cup of plastic coffee. I'm buying an all metal percolator.I gave the coffeemaker 2 stars instead of 1, because it looks nice, works well, and is easy to clean. If only it made better coffee."
Heather G.,4.0,"March 31, 2015","I did lots of research when switching from a keurig to a ""plain old coffee maker"".  The other, more expensive one I wanted was on backorder everywhere , so I settled for this one (my runner up).  For the price point, it is great.  Has all of the features you actually need and use.  I think the only thing it lacks (that I've noticed so far) is the ability to set different times for the auto on programmable feature.  I believe some of the more expensive models have this option.  With this one, you can only preset one time. However, since it pauses when the carafe is removed...it isn't a big deal to wait for the first cup to be made if you need to wait till you actually get up to turn it on.  The only downside  is that you MUST set the time as soon as you turn it on. Otherwise, it will automatically set to 12:00 and you have to set your programmed time based on that.  I learned this the hard way.  The only way I found to reset the clock was to leave it unplugged overnight.  This means when daylight savings time hits you can't easily/quickly fix the clock."
Zoog,1.0,"March 3, 2013","Understand, this review has nothing to do with the wonderful institution of Amazon. The BVMC-SJX33GT arrived on time and perfect condition. Clock does not light up. After setting brew time you must push a brew strength button, any time you want coffee. A total of 2 buttons, just to start the brewing process?!?! Can some one tell me why? On the sixth pot, that I brewed through the water filter, I noticed the coffee in the pot was not as dark as usual. Over half of the grounds, in the permanent filter, where DRY!!! I had to re-pore the hot colored water, to re-saturate the grounds in the filter, from my 32 oz. cup!!! Needless to say, spend another minute or so on clean up. SO, I may have to design and fab a ""distribution plate"" and place it on top of the filter OR perhaps, silicone caulk the bottom and 1/4"" up around the side of the permanent filter, to ensure full grounds saturation, FROM THE BOTTOM UP!!! WTF, MR. COFFEE... Do you just build stuff and not use them??? Why even bother with a clock you can't see??? Why have a brew strength button to push, when the water can only filter through, as fast as the water filter will allow anyway??? My last coffee brewer was made by Kenmore and though it wasn't perfect, it only cost me $25 and lasted me 7 years. I gave you the benefit of the doubt but don't think I will ever buy another one of your products!!! NUFF SAID >:("
Damon Carter,2.0,"January 24, 2019","I got this coffee maker with high hopes, and it initially served me well.  The features were fine and the coffee was good.  All was well with the world.  Then one day, all the lights came on, but it didn't start brewing coffee.  I unplugged it, and plugged it back in, but nothing.  My Mr. Coffee failed me when I needed it most.  It served up some tasty coffee for 3.5 years, but my cheap Sunbeam coffee maker that I purchased over 10 years previously churned out go-juice like a champ, and still worked when I donated it to my local thrift shop.  I have regrets.  I traded a proven coffee delivery system for something shiney, but ultimately without substance."
MrBob,5.0,"December 21, 2013","After reading the reviews on Amazon and other retailers I was pretty confident I would purchase this unit. The only thing holding me back was the amount of buyers who stated that there was a horrible smell that was quite difficult to get rid of. I took a chance and ordered it anyway. I am sure glad I did. There was no odor at all. The instructions tell you to run a pot of water through the system before making a pot of coffee. I did but added a little white vinegar along with the water. ( This I learned from a coffee web site )Love all the features about this coffee maker. Fits great under my cabinets, doesn't take up too much counter space, the beep when the coffee is done and the coffee taste great. If I can find any fault with this maker it is the water filter that is included. The instructions are really not clear enough. I have yet to figure it out. No matter the coffee is great. Out of my 5  coffee makers I have owned in my adult life time this has to be the best."
mossmouse,3.0,"March 24, 2014","EDIT: After using it a few months now, there is a more serious problem that we've seen in other reviews, it fills way too fast and overflows! When you take the carafe out it drips faster than when the carafe was in and makes a mess. We used the included filter to see if that would slow it down, but unless we are only making a 4 or 6 cup pot it's a mess. We've tried different filters and different coffee's, no success.After a very good experience with Amazon Returns (the first one that arrived had a cracked carafe), we were very excited to try out our first ""decent"" coffee maker after using the cheapest ones we could find for a few years. Extremely happy with the features and the only thing amiss that we can find is that the measuring lines on the carafe do not equal the measuring lines on the side of the coffee maker. If we fill the carafe to 8 cups, it is closer to the 10 cup line when we pour it in. But that is minor all things considered."
M.C,4.0,"October 3, 2014","Works well and doesn't burn the coffee, you can switch between Glass or Thermal. It has auto shutoff and only 3 Beeps to let you know coffee is ready.

Carole59r,5.0,"January 22, 2015","I've had this coffee maker for about 6 months, and it's still working as good as the first time I used it with no problems. I use it to make both coffee and ice tea, eliminating the need for a tea maker. I like that it gives you the option of setting it to ""strong"" if you like stronger coffee. It beeps when it's finished brewing--an ok feature, but it usually takes 1-2 minutes longer for all the water to finish filtering through after the beep. There's also a delay brew, which I haven't yet used, but it would be convenient for someone who likes their cup of java as soon as their feet hit the floor. I've only used it with the glass decanter, although it has a ""thermal"" setting for a carafe. Overall, I like the Mr. Coffee coffee maker, and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again."
A. A.,3.0,"September 15, 2015","Mr. Coffee must be designed to fail after a year.  There have been a handful of complaints I have about this machine.  But one thing that is does, that some of the other Mr. Coffees are not so good at, is it pours smoothly, without dripping all over.Now for it's failures:The hot water drips too forcefully causing the coffee grounds to go to one side, resulting in very weak coffee, and dry coffee grounds.  I had dealt with this by packing the coffee grounds down.  But it still happens.When brewing coffee you have to press two buttons to make it strong.  It's default is always ""regular"" (weak, tea like).The place where you pour the water in, is really close to the coffee filter, leading to cold water pouring into the fresh coffee grounds; this results in coffee grounds going into the coffee.  And sometime the coffee completely missing the coffee pot and simply pours out onto the heat plate."
Rick,4.0,"October 3, 2015","This is a great coffee maker.  I just wish they'd advertised that it beeps when it's done.  That seems to be the standard now with the automatic ones.Five stars if you could turn off the beeper.  Avoid this coffee maker if you have a dog.Who thinks that a non-optional beeping noise early in the morning is a good idea?Don't try this unless you don't care about the warranty and are confident in taking your life into your own hands -- unplug the thing first!!!  I was able to remove the beeper myself by removing six plugs hiding screws inside the water door -- they don't look like plugs, but look for the screw towers.  The plugs can be removed by gently prying with a jeweler's screwdriver.  The rest of the procedure is pretty obvious.

JF,5.0,"January 24, 2014","We have had other, higher end brands of coffee makers (Cuisinart, Kitchenaid, Delonghi) but this one is probably the best.  It pours water without spilling (I would recommend AGAINST a Kitchenaid for this reason), it doesn't drip water when removing the pot or the basket, easy to work, intuitive and a great price for what you get.  I would never again spend more for one of the other brand coffee makers, as this one has all of the functionality of them, plus brews a comparable cup of coffee, keeps it hot after brewing and doesn't break the bank.  The only small consideration is that you have to manually move the ""spout"" that sprays water on the coffee grounds in order to remove the basket, but a minor issue.  After you replace the basket, it automatically moves it back to the correct place, which is handy.  I wish they had done the automatic movement the other way as well, but not annoying enough to detract from a 5 star rating.  Don't spend more when this is a great coffee maker at a better price!!"
Bare,2.0,"December 16, 2013","Let me first say that the ""strong brew"" feature is not just broken on my pot, it is universally broken.  I spoke with Mr. Coffee about it and was informed that this is a known problem with this pot, they're ALL broken, but because not everyone uses the feature they continue to make and sell these.  I was actually told that if I wanted a pot with the strong brew feature that I'd need to return this pot and purchase an entirely different model.  For a pot that has been in circulation for a few years it astounds me that they haven't fixed this.  They did give me the standard disclaimer, ""we're working on a fix"".With that said, I bought this pot based solely on the fact that Consumer Reports rates this pot very highly, because reviews here are mixed.  At this price ($24) I figured I'd try it.  I was replacing an older Cuisinart DCC-1200 which has given me years of good use until recently.  My first impression was how cheap this unit seemed, both in fit and finish.  I mean, I expect consumer electronics to be cheaply made nowadays, but this was really something.  The filter basket just rests in the maker, so when the pot is in place the spring that is supposed to ""close"" the filter basket actually lifts the basket up and out of place.  This is hard to explain in text, but my Cuisinart filter basket actually clipped in place to prevent this problem.  This is just one example of the poor quality, I could list more.As a person who really goes through a lot of coffee I was quickly able to determine the good and bad of this pot.  I typically brew 2-3 12 cup pots a day, using the thermal carafe on this unit that increased since the thermal carafe only holds 8 cups.  I did like some of the features, but there was nothing new or innovative about them to set them apart from other machines.  Mine did have a bad plastic smell/taste even after running 6 or so pots through it to clean it, but after a few more pots that went away and wasn't a problem again.  The thermal carafe did an ok job of holding the coffee warm if I pre-heated it with hot water before actually brewing coffee into it.  The design of the lid for the thermal carafe was really ""clunky"" (for lack of a better word).  It screws down onto the pot and it was oddly difficult to get the threads started without it wanting to cross-thread.  When it came time to pour coffee a half-turn of the lid would let coffee out but SO SLOWLY.  The lid is also equipped with what is supposed to be a ""one way"" valve, but since it's gravity operated it opens when pouring and, with a full pot, you end up with coffee coming out of 2 places at once.  To get the last cup of coffee out of the pot you had to remove the lid entirely and basically turn the carafe upside down.I could go on, but I won't.  The only reason I give this pot 2 stars is because, at the end of the day, it did make an OK cup of coffee.  My biggest problems were with the quality of the unit, the thermal carafe (which is a separate purchase), and my biggest issue - the broken ""strong brew"" setting that they aren't doing anything to fix.I hope this helps someone else!"
Ike,5.0,"October 6, 2013","Well the first concern was that people complained about a plastic smell/taste, after running this through 5 times and just giving it a nice cleaning I haven't had any problems, one thing I never could figure out is how to use the cleaning cycle which it says it has, I tried holding down the select/on button and waiting for something to turn red but didn't have any luck but either way it's clean now, I think maybe that option only works when you run the coffee maker a certain amount of times but who knows! If you are having trouble with the coffee spilling out and not going into the coffee pot, make sure to move the lever to the left and lift it on top of the first groove, when I was trying with just water and it was leaking onto the counter I thought maybe I had the wrong size coffee pot or something. Well not much else to say except it's working great and the coffee tastes even better especially with the recommended permanent coffee filter!"
Amazon Customer,1.0,"May 4, 2015","Works like a coffee maker should. Priced right. Plus, it seems to have as much chrome per square inch (relatively speaking) as a 1953 Buick, so it looks good.This coffee maker represents all that we have come to expect from American capitalism*** Edit 6/24/2016. This Mr Coffee died yesterday, Bought it on April 21, 2015 and liked it. Very disappointed that it failed so quickly and have reduced my 5 star rating to 1 star. Even tried to fix it, but it's pointless.Got less than 400 cups of coffee out of it, and that kind of performance is horrible in my view. That's about 7 cents per cup + cost of coffee!INo more Mr Coffee for me. I have ordered a different brand coffee maker. Hopefully, it will and make a hotter cup of coffee and the thing will last longer than 14 months."
Kinimaka,4.0,"December 3, 2014","Just received my Mr Coffee maker, in a timely manner. So far, it works as designed; brews a good cup of coffee and the delayed brew ensures it's piping hot and waiting for me when I wake up. It's a little too early to address the reliability of this item, but I can tell you I would have given it 5 Stars if not for the terrible taste and smell of the machine after the first few brews. Following the instructions, I washed/ran through the coffee maker more than a few times, with plain water. However, it wasn't until probably the tenth brewing of actual coffee, that any hint of that awful plastic taste disappeared. And to date, the plastic smell in the immediate vicinity of the coffee maker still persists. I will come back periodically to update the reliability question. Overall, I am pleased with this coffee maker and very pleased with Amazon."
mks,2.0,"February 7, 2016","Positives:>  Gave it a chance, despite all the (bad) reviews mentioning the ""plastic"" smell/taste - and we did not experience that. Liked it very much.>  Lasted a whole year* (daily use) before it just stopped working - lights come on, but does not begin brewing.Negatives:>  Lasted only a year before it stopped working (noted as a positive above because I now see several reviews indicating the exact same thing happened to others after only a few months).Note:  My sister has the same model and it has worked fine for them for years. Guess we are just among the unlucky minority."
Berkeley Grandma,4.0,"September 18, 2012",This is very good coffee maker
J,2.0,"March 17, 2012","There are some things I really like about this coffee maker.--I like the option to have an insulated carafe instead of the glass.  I've made coffee in the early morning and come back for more mid afternoon and when using the insulated carafe, with the lid screwed on tightly, it has still be steaming hot, without getting that stale, nasty old coffee taste. The coffee maker automatically senses when you're using the insulated carafe and turns off the heating plate automatically.  Very nice feature.--I have small kids and I like that the beeping that alerts you that it is finished brewing is not too loud.  I had another Mr. Coffee coffee maker that had beeping so loud that it would wake my kids up in the morning, when they were sleeping on the other end of the house.Unfortunately, there are more things that I don't like...--Every time I pour a cup of coffee, the carafe leaks all over the counter.  Unless you are extremely careful to hold the carafe at an exact angle, it drips A LOT.--If I make more than 8 cups of coffee (the glass carafe accommodates up to 12 cups) I end up with coffee grounds in my coffee.  I used the coffee measurements given in the manual that came with the coffee maker but this continues to happen.  Seems like it is generally okay as long as I don't want more than 8 cups.  Unfortunately, I usually want more than 8 cups-- that's why I bought a coffee maker that can make up to 12.  Hmmm... frustrating.--The little water filter that comes with the machine gets coffee grounds all over it after every brewing.  It isn't so easy to clean and gets VERY worn, very quickly.  It is supposed to last for a month but it was all stained and straggly within just a few days of brewing coffee daily.--This machine has some sort of fresh brew timer, to tell you how long the coffee has been sitting there on the hot plate (not when using the insulated carafe).  This timer isn't very easy to see.  It doesn't automatically show you that time and pushing the button to get it to show doesn't always seem to work.I received this coffee maker as a gift at the end of January, and have been using it almost daily, hoping that I would find the tricks that would make me like it more.  Maybe I would perfect how to pour the coffee without dripping it all over the counter with every pour.  Maybe I would figure out the trick to not get coffee grounds in my pot of coffee.  Now it has been about 7 weeks and I'm ready to give up.  I've had a few too many undrinkable pots of coffee, along with messy counters.  Unfortunately I'm just out of my return period, so... I guess this one will just be moving to the garage to be replaced by something that works a little better.I had high hopes for this one but I wouldn't buy it again."
Retfireman,5.0,"January 27, 2014","We received this coffee maker in excellent condition and was packaged so well, with no damage and or problems.  We followed the instructions for cleaning and removing any unnecessary production smells.  Our first pot of coffee was excellent and still did have a slight hint of plastic odor, but not offensive enough to warrant discarding the coffee.  The second making of coffee had no further hint of any residual plastic smell or taste.  The appearance of the the coffee pot on our black granite counters and stainless steel appliances shines like a diamond amongst them.  i certainly have found no problems with this coffee pot with taste and or appearance.  I read every review about this pot and found that a lot of people certainly must different ideas of just what a coffee pot should comprise of.  If their is a better value on the market, I certainly did not find it!"
Deborah Tickle,4.0,"September 20, 2013","All the reviews that say this coffee maker initially has a very strong plastic smell are correct.  And they are correct that the plastic smell doesn't go away very quickly.  Mine took about four weeks of daily use to stop being smelly.  Once you get this coffee maker ""broken in"", it is probably the best designed $35 coffee maker on the market.  The controls are easy to use, the basket is easy to empty and fill, it is easy to fill with water, it makes a half pot of coffee in about six minutes, the pot pours without dripping, and the coffee tastes great.  Be advised that you may have to use a little more coffee than in some other coffee makers to get it as strong as you want. The so called chrome face looks a lot like shiny plastic (because that it what it is), but you can accept that since you should not expect stainless steel for $35."
Kindra,5.0,"December 19, 2012","I purchased the Mr. Coffee coffeemaker and a more expensive coffee maker certified by the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA).  I ended up returning the more expensive coffee maker and keeping the cheaper Mr. Coffee.  It brews a full carafe of coffee in 7 minutes which was just slightly longer than the expensive coffee maker.  It also has features which I've come to expect with coffee makers--timed delay, clock, and even a button which tells you how long ago the coffee was brewed.As many other reviewers have complained, this coffee maker did come with a rather strong plastic smell.  I ran thru 2 pots of water to try and remove the smell, but it still lingered.  Since I was doing a taste comparison, I ran thru a pot of coffee to compare taste and quality with the other coffee maker.  The smell disappeared after running thru the coffee and never returned and wasn't discernable in the cup of coffee.Bottom line--can't beat this coffee maker especially when you take into account the price!"
JC,3.0,"January 18, 2014","So this was our third (and likely final) replacement for our beloved Krups brewer that bit the dust in early December. We tried a Cuisinart but the carafe leaked like a sieve and it was very user unfriendly. Next was a Waring Professional that was as flimsy as just-about-to-fall-apart can be. It was a spring-loaded nightmare waiting to happen and an utter disappointment, not to mention the 16 minute brew time. Finally, we bit the bullet and went for the no-frills Mr. Coffee. Having had it for about 2 weeks now, it is a fine brewer. Pros: easy to set up, doesn't drip, acceptable brew time, user friendly. Cons: cheapo construction, basket-style filter (I prefer cone), no backlight on the clock (WTF?), tons of condensation on the lid after use, doesn't brew quite hot enough. Overall, not great by any means, but it brews a decent cup of coffee and that's that."
swimfins,5.0,"January 14, 2014","This is one of the best coffee makers I've every had.  Period.  I've had it for about 15 months and make a pot a day.When it was time to replace my old Bunn I searched for a basket filter, 12 cup, programmable coffee maker.  After narrowing the choices, this one seemed to be the right one based on price, design, functions, and ratings (here and other sites).  I was prepared to spend up to $100 for a new coffee maker, but was happy to try this one for significantly less.  I couldn't be happier.I appreciate the easy programming (as I get up super early and have it set to start about 15 minutes before my alarm).  The programming is straight-forward and, importantly (to me), the clock keeps good time so I'm not having to adjust it every few months.The coffee is piping hot without being burned, even after two hours on the hotplate.  I don't have a ""drip issue"" with the carafe like other brands, or when pouring before the brew cycle is done.I can wholeheartedly recommend this coffeemaker without reservation."
Annie,5.0,"February 1, 2015","I was really disappointed when a coffee maker I bought less than 6 mo's ago died. I can't say I was excited to receive the new one, just wondering how long it will last. I do not understand why coffee maker's install three or more little lights and they all light up if I turn one on. I could use it for a Christmas ornament next year if it's still around.I don't understand why the white, round, circular filter sits on top of coffee grounds since I have a water filter on my faucet (I used it once and compared to brew with out the filter). The coffee does not brew as strong as I like, will play with it more to find out why. In this moment, I'm just grateful to have a working coffee maker."
Timk,3.0,"November 20, 2015","I've had three of these now and although it is a good coffee maker they only last about 6 months.  It has two burners, one to keep the coffee hot and the other to boil the water up into the grounds.  I found that over time the boil burner slows to a crawl or stops all together. I thought it was from hard water clogging the tube but I've taken the last two apart and found nothing wrong with the tubes.  I've come to the conclusion that either they've built-in a short life span so you have to buy another one or used cheap parts such as the sensor that tells the boil burner to turn on and off.  Either way I'm going to try a different brand this time unless someone gives me one then I'll use it until it breaks again."
Jo Holland,3.0,"March 31, 2013","I choose this model largely for appearance.  I had no way of knowing that the plastic it is made from has a bad odor.  And the clock numerals are NOT back lighted, which makes them almost impossible to see unless you are bent down in front of the maker.  I ran hot water through it several times and then used baking soda before making coffee.  The coffee is okay and doesn't have the odor but when you open the top to pour water, the smell is still there.  I've only had it for a week so maybe this will pass.On the plus side, it is easy to use and looks good in my kitchen which has other black appliances.  I like that it shuts off after two hours and that you can pour a cup without waiting till it is finished brewing.  Since I bought this with Discover Reward Points and it had free shipping I feel it is still a very good deal.  Just hope it lasts!  Time will tell."
T. Ryan Harris,5.0,"November 15, 2014","This purchase is one of the best I have made on Amazon.  I bought this to replace a Black and Decker 12 cup maker that sold for around 20 bucks.  This Mr Coffee was like comparing apples to oranges.  The other merely  just did the job.  Towards the end it making strange noises and the ""non stick"" surface was not non stick.  This Mr Coffee is a dream in comparison.  It was so quiet that I was not sure that it was even working.  I do recommend buying the Mr. Coffee GTF2-1 Basket-Style Gold Tone Permanent Filter with it.  Having the Amazon Prime made delivery fast and both came together.  If you are looking for the perfect gift for Christmas, this model performs like the ones Braun.  I chose not to get the metal decanter, only because I already have one."
pg2007,1.0,"May 21, 2014","I ordered one of these from Amazon.  It arrived with brew basket drain plug (the part that opens when the carafe is inserted and closes when it is withdrawn) that did not function.  The plug was always closed, since the basket sat too high in its ""pocket"" within the machine.  Many attempts to adjust this failed, so I sent it back.A second (replacement) was sent by Amazon, but it HAD EXACTLY THE SAME DEFECT.This time I went back to Mr. Coffee and ordered a warranty replacement of a different model coffeemaker.I would not advise anyone order this coffeemaker until this defect is remedied by the manufacturer."
Ryan,3.0,"January 17, 2021",The coffee maker came with one of the latches to the top broken. Also the coffee maker won't program. I've done everything the directions say to program it but it just doesn't do anything. I'm not sure if I just got a defective one or if this is a common problem with the product as a whole.
Robert Chiczewski,2.0,"October 23, 2019",This model has a major flaw.  It does not last long because it starts leaking after 2 or 3 years.  I have bought this product twice and both times the machine became unoperable.Apparently this seems to be rampant among drip coffee makers because my Cusinart has now started to leak at only 2.5 years old.  I think a coffee maker should last 5 to 10 years or make the water container easy to replace.
Joe K,1.0,"February 22, 2019","Purchased a Mr. Coffee Pot and lasted 7+ years, so I purchased this model, it automatically came up as the same coffee pot I had purchased 7 years or so ago and the original one lasted so long (with routine cleaning) that I went for Mr. Coffee again....I noticed the new one Amazon said I purchased previously didn't look the same as the old one, but figured it was just an update to my original.  Was able to brew one pot, then stopped brewing on the second pot.  Tried the delay feature, resetting, lights came on, just didn't start heating and brewing....going right back....thank god for my trusty french press!"
MeganJ,1.0,"July 10, 2014","I loved the appearance of this coffee pot, and it had all of the functions that I really appreciate in a coffee pot.  I waited a few months to unpack it after I purchased it-normally the items I get from Amazon are awesome, awesome, awesome.  I have been using this pot for about ten days now, and I have not had a consistent pot of coffee since.  I put 8 cups in-sometimes I get two, sometimes I get six, sometimes I get four.  Sometimes the coffee is watery, sometimes it completely misses the pot when it brews, and rarely (once) it was perfect.  Don't be fooled by the appearance (shame on me)-this coffee pot is messy, inefficient and way more stress first thing in the morning than I need."
Sandy,1.0,"October 25, 2016","Terrible coffee maker.  Don't waste your money.  First one bought broke & was replaced.  Now the replacement isn't working correctly.  It's been less than a year since my initial purchase!  I'm buying a different brand this time!EDIT TO RESPOND TO MR. COFFEE:6500 reviews of this model and an average of 1 in every 5 customers give your product one(1) star.Sunbeam has already replaced the initial unit for me.  Now the replacement is not working correctly.  As stated above, I have purchased a different brand coffee maker.Refund the $29.99 I paid for this clearly faulty product!"
C,4.0,"July 10, 2014","We have a Kerig but, the be honest, it's too costly for 3 big coffee drinkers. So...this is a great product for the price! I highly recommend getting the permanent gold filter for this maker, it's worth the money. The operation is pretty straight forward, especially if you read the manual before you use it. I read the other reviews, put simply, read the directions! Some of the stuff is just unavoidable. Drips on the hot plate during the pause function...the distributor is going to be wet, just wipe the hot plate with a towel. The list goes on. Just read the manual. It makes a great cup of coffee, it looks good, and it's affordable. The only negative is that the display is not back lit."
Koko,2.0,"January 15, 2014","After using this coffee maker for about a week, we're returning it. We like our coffee fairly strong and no matter what we do there are grounds in the coffee. Tried using less coffee and putting it on the strong setting and more coffee on the regular setting, same result. We have never had this problem with any other coffee maker so I don't think it's user error. We did seem to have to use an extra scoop of coffee to make it the same strength we are used to. Don't know why it doesn't brew as strong as other brands. We have never used the strong brewing setting on others. So, if you like your coffee even somewhat strong, this may not be the coffee maker for you. Also, it's REALLY bright chrome, doesn't look great next to my stainless appliances. If it worked well, would have overlooked the appearance."
S. Sidman,5.0,"January 17, 2015","I have well water, so I have gone through many brands and styles of coffee makers.  This tops my list of favorites.  It's rare to find a carafe that doesn't dribble coffee on the counter while you are pouring the first few cups, but this one pours perfectly.  Not to mention that the carafe doesn't collect water in the handle whenever you put it in the dishwasher...several other brands did, which made for water spills when removing the clean carafe from the dishwasher.  Plus it brews fast, allows you to select your coffee strength, is programmable, shuts itself off after 2 hours, and has an indicator to tell you when you need to clean the unit.  Now if it will only stand up to the high calcium level of my well water, this will be a match made in heaven!  Time will tell."
T. Troha,2.0,"March 17, 2016","I liked it fine until about 3 months in, when 2 minutes after starting the machine the 2-hour shutoff warning beeps would sound.  I ignored that, since the coffee continued to brew.....until this morning, when the beeps sounded with an inch of coffee in the pot and it shut off for good.  I still get all the cool lights, but no hot coffee.  Now it's a doorstop.UPDATE:  I was able to return this machine for a prompt replacement, for which I was grateful.  However, less than a year later, the same thing is happening again.  2 days ago the ""brewing is complete"" beeps sounded when 8 of the 10 cups were in the carafe.  Yesterday it beeped at 7.5 cups.  This morning 6 cups....  I anticipate this machine, too, will be another doorstop by the end of the week.  I am going to purchase a Hamilton Beach at WalMart for $15."
Johnny,3.0,"February 1, 2012","There is not much I need from a coffee maker other than I can preset a brewing time and that it makes coffee in a respectable time frame.  So 5 stars for that. However, I don't understand why they made the spout so narrow that it runs down the front of it when you pour. (This creates a mess) Also why are people saying that it has a wide water resevour? It doesn't, it's pretty narrow. Short electrical cord is true and tall so it doesn't fit well under cabinet when the lid is propped open.  Which leads into a F.Y.I. you will want to open the lid when your coffee drinking time is over because there is a substantial amount of moisture build up inside that stays for a  long time running a risk for mold. Preset brewing is kind of tricky in the beginning to remember the steps to take. Price is good. Haven't tried to fill my cup during brewing so I can't report on that. Sorry for any weird words from my phones auto correct. Hopefully I got them all."
Riverman,2.0,"February 18, 2013","I bought this unit as a Christmas present for my wife, to match our new kitchen, which had been completely gutted and remodeled. The stylish black and chrome looks great on the new countertop, unfortunately this coffee maker has some real problems. The worst is that you have to be VERY careful to make sure the carafe is placed exactly, perfectly and completely into the unit or coffee will run out all over everything. The carafe canot be off even a hair or hot coffee will start to run out in a minute or so. This has happened several times, including 2 days ago when coffee ran out and partially filled a drawer below it with hot coffee. Needless to say mama was not happy with the coffee maker or me! Luckily we have caught it each time and minimized the harm, but we are so fearful of a repeat that we never use the program function for fear that 12 cups of coffee will run out all over the new kitchen while we are upstairs getting ready for work. Frankly I don't want to have to stand guard over the unit while making coffee every day.The other issue is the smell, no the FUNKY smell that seems a permanent part of the water resevoir. Our water is fine, city water we drink every day with no odor or other problems. But the reservoir simply reeks of stagnant water or something. Trust me; as an old ""river rat"" I KNOW what funky water smells like! No amount of cleaning or flushing has made any difference. Anyway we have had Mr. Coffee products for nearly 40 years but this one is a beautiful dud.I am going to buy another BASIC Mr. Coffee 12 cup coffee maker, just like the last 2 or 3 previous ones; only this one in black to match the new kitchen. Sorry folks, I REALLY wanted to like and keep this unit but it is getting trashed due to poor functionlity."
Brian,4.0,"February 17, 2014","I have used Mr. Coffee for a while now, and this was a gift to replace an old Krups unit.  The coffee machine looks nice and works well.  The LED lights are brighter than other units I have used in the past (blue LEDs may be a good or bad thing in your opinion). The unit uses flat-bottom, paper filters.  The unit it replaced had a permanent filter, but that was known going in.  This does brew more quickly than the Krups unit did, albeit not extraordinarily fast (read that as no 3-minute pots).  The biggest complaint, and the reason for the 1-star ding is that the carafe tends to allow coffee to spill when pouring and to drip down the side of the carafe if not careful. For a full pot, this carafe requires a slow, gentle pour."
No Cuisinart DCC 1400!,1.0,"January 4, 2018","Never worked properly from Day One! Mostly gave us 1/2 a carafe or lesser seldom more, then after a month lesser and lesser until 2-3 ounces only and then not even hot and finally nothing! No coffee no heat no brewing! When I called Mr Coffee they said they will send a replacement. That was 4 months ago and even turned a new year! No replacement and no shipment email or explanation of any kind. Recently I stopped at a garage sale and they had the deluxe model thermal carafe with the double pipes 12 cup programmable. Seller said it didn't work for them either. Worse the insulation lining peeled off and now it may be dangerous to use. Do not waste your time and money buying this brand. It is not the same company and for me little integrity."
ShooteRN,3.0,"May 18, 2014","I have owned over the years many, many coffeemakers. Mr. Coffee, Black & Decker, Procter Silex and on and on. Is there any coffeemaker that is made today that doesn't drizzle coffee onto the hotplate when you use the vaunted 'Pause and Serve' feature?!  I saw that a consumer mag gave this unit a high rating based on this and that. Fine. All that is great. But it's 2014 and why is coffee dripping onto the warming plate when I take the carafe out during the brew cycle? It didn't used to be like that. Go back far enough and the spring/gasket in the brew basket on earlier models (80's 90's) were far stronger. It's not just Mr. Coffee, it's all of them in my experience. To some reviewers, it might be nothing as a detraction to buying."
Physorcist,2.0,"September 6, 2016","I purchased this machine a year and a half ago, and it worked mostly fine - until it didn't, for no apparent reason: it was happily brewing a new pot of coffee, and it just suddenly stopped in the middle. The display, buttons, and lights all continued to appear to work, but the machine would no longer heat the water and feed it through the grinds. I assume that there was some disconnect in the wiring between the display and the heating mechanism, but I'm not sure.I should also say that twice I had the problem of the plastic basket filling with water and overflowing. Contrary to D. Diggler's review, it is *not* difficult to make this mistake, for it lies not in using extra filters, grounds clogging the plastic basket, or placing the carafe incorrectly. Rather, the problem is that you have to carefully replace the plastic basket: it's fairly easy to place it so that it doesn't rest as far down as possible in its holder, so that the spring mechanism that opens the valve when resting on the top of the carafe doesn't actually reach the carafe and so stays closed. The plastic basket does have a correct orientation (the back has little plastic guides), but they leave enough wiggle room that you can still place it such that it'll overflow.When the machine stopped working, I initially considered buying the same one again (and I considered giving it three stars), but the fact that I've had one just stop working on me without warning changed my mind. I'm not buying another."
Mule Skinner,1.0,"December 7, 2015","Bought this in February 2015 and it stopped working December 2015.  Didn't last a year.  Tried cleaning, but that was not the problem.  Seems valve won't let water thru.  Tried cleaning several times and after an hour finally all water & cleaning agent does come thru and water looks clean, but it doesn't help speed up the brewing process to a reasonable amount of time."
Frank L,2.0,"January 24, 2016","Bought one at local big chain store, lasted for 3 1/2 months and just stopped working. Warranty is one year and getting a resolution and replacement coming was pretty easy. Due to length of time before replacement would arrive, I bought another at Amazon thinking who couldn't use a spare pot, right?That one made it 6 months before just ""up and quitting"" like the first. So...now I am using the first warranty replacement and am going to get replacement on the second one. Really disappointed in this unit, thought Mr. Coffee would be a better brand. So, I don't recommend buying this model, although when it worked it worked fine. Also, no back light on clock...so unless you have light directly on it you'll be using a flashlight to set the delay at night, poor design there!"
Whitney S.,4.0,"March 8, 2018","This coffee maker brews quickly, keeps coffee hot without burning and I enjoy some of the features like being able to remove the carafe while it's still brewing and it stops perking automatically.  While it looks nice, it feels cheap. It is very hard to read the display time because it doesn't light up and the angle makes a glare.But it's easy to operate.  This is actually my second one - I had to return the first because it was defective right out of the box! But i literally received the replacement w/in 2 days of printing my return label and it's been working almost non-stop.  Beware, it literally ships in the Mr. Coffee box with the label right on the top."
Caerwyn0819,5.0,"May 18, 2013","This is the best coffee maker I've purchased in years.  I had a DeLonghi that was given to me for my wedding, but it leaked on the counter and was a huge waste of space.  This barely takes up any room on my kitchen counters.I love the option of the regular or strong brew (I use strong anyway), the automatic starter for when you don't want to make the coffee when you wake up, and the shut-off time.  It's also helpful if someone in your household is in a rush and needs to pour their coffee in their travel mug; it stops dripping when you pull the carafe out so you can send someone along their way, happily caffeinated.Another bonus is being able to pour water in the reserve without it leaking down the outside of the carafe.  It was so annoying!  This one lets you pour out 12 cups of water into the reserve without one drop spilling onto your countertops, and you can pretty much just dump the water in as quickly as you need to (just be careful where you aim)!Mr. Coffee is the way to go.  I have a feeling we will have this for YEARS before we need to replace it."
Tim Fleming,3.0,"January 22, 2014","In quest of a decent cup of joe without spending a fortune, I bought this one based on all the positive reviews. I also bought a Bunn Phase Brew HT Thermal Carafe Brewer (at Costco). This is what I know after a few days:Brewed coffe temp:Bunn: 170-180Mr Coffee: 150-160After 2.5 hrs:Bunn: 155Mr C: 140Pluses for the Bunn:Stainless steel basket is very easy to clean. Plastic basket with filter on top is fussy with the Mr C.Mostly stainless construction vs. plasticHot plate helps get and keep carafe hot (shuts off automatically shortly after brewing so no burning/bitterness)Minuses for Bunn:There's a little rubber gasket on top of the carafe. It fell out once. Now I'll have to keep an eye on it.Longer brew time: 10-12 minutes vs 8 minutes w/Mr C (not really a big deal for me)Louder (again, personally that doesn't bother me)You can't tell from across the room if the coffee is done brewing or not (Mr C has an LED light that is easily seen from a distance)Pluses for Mr C:FasterQuieterProbably a little less money (don't forget to include the cost of the carafe which is an extra)Carafe pours easier for the last half cup or so.My wife says it's prettierMinuses for Mr C:A couple of times now, when pouring water in the reservoir, it has leaked through the basket onto the hot plate.TASTE:So far, the Bunn coffee tastes heartier yet also smoother. Mr C is bland in comparison. I've tried a light (Strbucks Veranda) and medium (Peet's Mr Dickson's) roast so far (no French roast yet).Taste trumps just about everything for me, so at this point I am favoring the Bunn"
TwinMom,1.0,"March 22, 2016","I bought this coffee maker based on low price and decent reviews.  However, after just 8 months, it stopped working.  Just. stopped.  Without any signs of problems.  Call me old-fashioned, but I feel like an appliance should work for longer than that."
Crimson Igarashi,3.0,"December 2, 2014","I don't know if we bought a faulty one or not. It's a good coffee pot, but the beeper that lets you know when the coffee is done now goes off when the coffee starts pouring. It started doing that about 4 months after we bought it.I wrote a review prior to this one, stating that the coffee pot was taking 4 times as long to brew, but I recently learned that it was because I wasn't cleaning it properly '^_^. After a good and ""proper"" cleaning, it now runs and tastes fine, other than the beeper not going off when it's supposed to.I put an ""okay"" for my review, because it was a gift for my fiance, and he says it's okay."
Jd chester springs,5.0,"February 26, 2014","My Keurig finally died and I didn't want to spend a lot of money replacing it. This pot was affordable and had a programmable feature (and pause feature) that I was looking for. I set it up at night so that my coffee is waiting for me when I get up, in this way it is even more convenient than the Keurig. I like not running out of pods all the time and just being able to pour another little half cup if I want and having a little leftover coffee to use up through the day. I really think this is a more economical way to enjoy coffee and the machine has worked perfectly. Glad I switched back to a traditional drip style pot, not missing my other machine at all!"
millerized,4.0,"June 21, 2015","So far, so good. Run at least 4 cycles of just water through it though. I ran 2, then made coffee. Straight into the sink it went. Tasted like hotel room coffee. The 5th run, did what I normally do, set it up for an overnight delay and coffee first thing in the AM.2nd cup so far this morning....and I'm good.(oh, and toss the little circle filters guys...they're not worth a crap. The thing sets on top of the filter basket, and you have to put it in/pull it out with each brewing cycle. The idea is cute, but 'built-in' designs are more intelligent. This setup just isn't very smart)"
irish_flu,5.0,"October 14, 2013","So my coffee maker died.  I love to research purchases, so I spent days drinking coffee singles and pouring over details and reviews and what-not.  I checked prices, blah blah blah.Then I realized that I drink flipping Folger's and I'm pretty happy with that, and I was happy with the basic programmable-model Mr. Coffee that died and precipitated this endeavor, so I bought this basic programmable Mr. Coffee.It's easy to use, looks like it will be easy to clean, it's easy to program, I seem to be able to operate it while in a coma, it makes coffee pretty quickly, and as an added bonus it uses the same carafe as my old dead coffee maker (so I have a spare).  I also don't seem to be spilling water all over, which is nice.This is a cheap-to-mid-line programmable drip coffee maker, and it excels at being that.  It's exactly what you expect it to be. There's nothing wrong with it whatsoever."
pvosman,4.0,"March 30, 2014","I really do love this coffee maker. It is beautiful, and amazing price. Works well with glass or stainless carafe. So smart it knows to turn the hot plate off when the stainless carafe is used.You don't need to change the setting. I would have given it 5 stars but it has 2 small flaws (in my opinion).  The water gauge is on the side toward the back so you need to shift the pot to see it  and the top opens to the side instead of from the front. This means you need to shift the position of the coffeemaker when filling it with water.The price of the coffeemaker plus the extra stainless carafe which is purchased separately was so much less than most coffeemakers(about $50). Great coffee and a bargain besides.The coffee is great and since I use the stainless carafe there is never a burnt taste and I save on electricity."
Gary Stanglewicz,5.0,"May 5, 2019","Not real fancy but the coffee has excellent flavor. Faster brewing than some of the coffee makers friends and family have.  Twelve cup capacity is great. We often make 2 or even 3 pots a day.  We replaced the same model we bought several years ago.  At this price it's not a hardship, plus we have a replacement carafe incase we need it."
John,5.0,"May 8, 2014","Carafe DOES NOT DRIP!!!! Of my last six coffee makers, only one had a carafe that didn't drip, a DeLonghi. (That was the only good thing about the DeLonghi. Setting its itme and time delay--a single button to roll the clock forward one minute at a time--was a royal pain and the thing broke a week after the warranty expired.) Setting the clock and time delay is quick since there is one button to set the hour and another to set the minute. The area around the hot plate where the carafe sits is sealed so that spills and over-flows do not seep into the base of the unit. It brews well from 12 down to 6 cups. My only concern is the water well never dries. The water well can't be dried by hand since it has has too many angles, ridges, small surfaces, channels, and tubing. All in all, a better product than most in its competitors costing costing as much as $20 more."
Dennis,5.0,"April 7, 2015",Great value for the money. I was considering a more advanced coffee maker but it would not have more than this one. It has a filter for the water and very easy and simple to use. The 1-4 cup serving makes the coffee stronger as well. What was very impressive for this unit was that the coffee comes out very HOT and it's great because it's hotter than any other coffee maker I've had. The brew is much better with hotter water as well. I usually add one less scoop of coffee for the total cups of water I add. So 8 cups of water  I add 7 scoops of coffee. You will have to experiment  couple time. The only thing that would be nice is a meter or a counter to let you know when to change the charcoal water filter. I'll have to future out where to buy it as well when i comes to that point.
mf2010,1.0,"July 1, 2016",I bought this coffee maker in November 2013.  Still makes coffee fine - no problem.  But heat plate finish does not hold up and is rusting/corroding badly.  Still works but looks awful.  I believe it will not last a lot longer and am concerned about it rusting through.  We have made a a real effort to keep it dry after use - as our last Mr. Coffee had the same problem.  This looked like a better quality model and we hoped it would last longer but it is not the case.  We have had other coffee makers in the past that lasted for 10+ years without any corrosion.  This is a product design flaw I am sure trading off cost savings with long term reliability.  This company needs to design integrity back into its products.  I remembered my Mom having one that must had lasted 20+ years.  Question is whether all brands in this price range all have the same poor quality now.....
Star,1.0,"December 23, 2015",Coffee pot quit working after a weeks use won't do anything.  Hand Washing carafe when noticed cracks around spout cracked all the way with small glass pieces on counterI cannot find decent coffee pot even when I purchased expensive ground beans and filtered water but never worked right always got mouthful of beansThe week this worked the coffee tasted good and enjoyed filtered water but hot sp mad when glass broke while preparing for return I destroyed the box so rightr now  after ripping up box in heat of moment I don't even think I can return for account credit and find another one
Xtian,4.0,"August 29, 2015","Have had this coffee make for a month or so now and have to say I am very pleased. Love the programmable brewing feature. Water temp seems to be fantastic. Haven't had any issues with the water filter although I see that as an optional use item. Brew time is pretty quick and with pause-and-pour you don't have to wait for an entire pot to be done before filling your cup. Interior builds up a lot of latent water so after the brew cycle is done I open up the lid - watch out for steam - to let the remaining water either brew through or evaporate. I live in a warm, humid environment and don't want to worry about mold in the machine."
V. Robinson,5.0,"November 6, 2013","The easiest model of ""Mr.Coffee"" to add water.  Have had many ""Mr. Coffee"" models over the years, which HAS lasted many years.  However, this model is far easier to add the water.  VERY stylish with the chrome and black....looks great on the counter! Has more features than what I need, but is there if ever I want to take advantage of them.  It was very reasonable in price and found Amazon had the best price all around.  The item was received very quickly.  The ""permanent"" basket is not included on this model.  I was able to use the one from the older model, as I find it's easier to remove the coffee grounds.  The most important thing is that it makes GREAT tasting coffee!  I highly recommend this model."
Kindle Customer,2.0,"September 29, 2013","The Mr.Coffee name caused me to try this coffee maker. It arrived promptly, however, it does not live up to the Mr. Coffee name as a quality product.Regarding the strong plastic smell. I have used this maker for a few weeks now and the vinegar solution did manage to alleviate the plastic taste. However, when the lid is raised there is still a strong plastic smell.The pause function is on all of the time. I have taken the basket apart trying to adjust the spring inside but it still does not work.The water fills up the basket and I have to raise the coffee pot up - hold and keep pressure on it- so the coffee will actually drip into the coffee pot.It does no good to set the timer because the coffee is held until I lift the pot up. Because of this, there becomes an issue with coffee grounds as well.This coffee maker is very lightweight and takes up little space. However, I am shopping for a different brand. t."
Denise I.,4.0,"December 9, 2011","This looks attractive on the counter top: shiny chrome, and pretty lights when in use.  I could not find the thermal carafe anywhere when I bought it mid-November.I was told that this was a new model still being developed! The brew time is determined by the strength you select. A tone sounds when brewing is done. I use my usual  recipe of two tablespoons for every eight ounces of water, rather than their recommended recipe.Face it, though. In the end, the quality of the coffee you use will determine the outcome. (DECEMBER 2011)UPDATE. MARCH 6,2012. IT DIED. MUST BE RETURNED TO FACTORY AND REPLACED.(AT MANUFACTURER COST.) I GET THIS FEELING THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO THEM BEFORE.(MAYBE THE NEW MODEL ISSUE-THEY SAID THEY WOULD BE SENDING A DIFFERENT MODEL IN RETURN.)"
HP,5.0,"January 19, 2014","So I read the reviews on this product in early Jan 2014. I returned two other coffee makers to Target and Bed Bath and Beyond for short comings. I’m pretty tough to please, especially in the am! In my opinion this coffee maker looks appropriate in our very nice kitchen and more importantly brews an awesome cup of coffee. The brew cycle is quick, quite, and reaches a hot temperature. When brewing is complete the machine conveniently emits two short beeps. I purchased the stainless thermal carafe and we just love it! When using the thermal carafe, the machine recognizes it automatically and turns off after the brew cycle to avoid “burning” the precious java. The thermal carafe keeps the coffee very hot for hours! Kinda like the thermos I used in school long long ago. This machine is superior to others we tried. Very pleased and highly recommend."
Michael A. Keaton,3.0,"July 15, 2013","I purchased this coffeemaker based on it's rating in Consumer Reports and the reviews here.  My experience hasn't been the same.  Maybe it's bad luck, but I had the same problem with two coffeemakers.  I'm now returning this one for something else.There is a setting on this coffeemaker to brew ""strong"" coffee, but it doesn't work with the optional thermal carafe.  If you use the carafe and select ""strong"" it brews for about 10 seconds and then shuts off.  If you use the ""regular"" setting it seems to work fine.It doesn't appear that the ""strong"" setting works with the glass carafe either.However, if you brew on the regular setting (or brew strong coffee by adding extra grounds) you may be happy."
R. Nelson,3.0,"May 12, 2015","After about 14-15 months, I woke up to a dead coffeemaker.  No warning, no death rattle.  It worked fine one day and simply did not the next.  The clock worked, the lights lit up, but no heat to make the unit operate.  This was not my favorite coffeemaker, so it's sudden death elicited a very short period of mourning.  The reasons for not liking this coffeemaker (other than a pre-mature death), would be construed as too petty to waste anyone's time with.  Suffice it to say we had irreconcilable differences.  Love/Hate, so to speak.....  I loved that it made my coffee everyday.  I hated everything else about it.  I was taught to only speak good of the dead.  It's dead.....GOOD !!!"
Scott Nickley,3.0,"November 26, 2013","I decided to spring for a more expensive coffeemaker after having disappointing experiences with the cheap lower-grade models. There are a lot of things I like about this model. I absolutely love the ability to choose between ""strong"" and ""regular"" while brewing. This setting really does make a difference in the coffee. I also love being able to set a time to have the coffee start. I know this is standard on a lot of coffeemakers now, but it was the first time I had one that could operate that way. It also comes with a water filter which seems to help the quality of the coffee.I was disappointed to find that the overall coffee quality still had the plastic-like taste that many coffee makers with plastic filter baskets seem to possess. However, I'm not sure if it is possible to get rid of this taste without a metal filter basket.All said, this is the best coffee maker I have owned, but I still prefer the taste of coffee shop coffee."
oeddie,1.0,"February 1, 2014","Absolutely the worst cup of coffee I ever had. Weak coffee no matter what I try. The strong brew function makes a cup of coffee that looks more like tea and tastes like hot water. I used 4 scoops of beans to make 16 ounces (my last coffeemaker, a Cuisinart, used two scoops for the same size coffee and the beverage was just right, I may return to the Cuisinart) and it was like drinking hot water with milk and 1 sugar. I called Mr Coffee and they have offered to replace this coffeemaker with another so we shall see. I commend them for replacing it but the appliance itself is terrible."
Steve,4.0,"June 30, 2011","We recently purchased this coffee maker here for a mere $29. So far, it is a reliable inexpensive coffee maker. I am not sure the stronger brew setting actually does this but we haven't tried the shorter brew time. We like the taste of the coffee. I did a lot of comparison shopping looking at $80 machines from other well known makers. They all had lower ratings than this cheap Mr. Coffee. We don't use the chlorine filter attachment as it is just one more item to clean after brewing. I don't know how effective it is in filtering out chlorine and I really don't care. When this little $29 machine quits working I will simply buy another. Some may complain about it's sound when brewing or the three beeps it sounds when coffee is done, or this or that. Not me."
Denise A. Williams,1.0,"November 17, 2013","My fourth Keurig's pump bit the dust and broke my heart for the last time. I decided to go old school and get a drip coffee maker. This model is actually the best selling here on Amazon. Have no idea why. It arrived, I cleaned everything, fixed up the water filter, loaded up the water tank, etc. Ran a pot of water through it and everything was fine. Next morning attempted to brew a pot of coffee...what a mess. Hardly any coffee in the carafe, but tons all over the counter. During the process of coffee running out of the machine all over the counter it shorted something electrical and now the unit is dead in the water. Threw it away and bought a Kitchen Aid. The KA works great. I think some of the cons of the Mr. Coffee are:The so called water filter is actually a stand alone unit that you place on top of grounds. Seriously, what? Perhaps that led to the water now draining  incorrectly.The unit itself is made of cheap material. The ""metal"" accents are actually cheap plastic painted with shiny silver paint.Okay I get that it is a inexpensive unit, but coffee is all Mr. Coffee does. Can't they improve this?Will NEVER buy another of their products."
SuBu,1.0,"June 25, 2016","I rarely come back to leave a review.Maybe I'm using this wrong but to me, this is the worst coffee pot ever..I have an argument with it almost every morning. Not sure if it's on my end or if it's a defect bc other reviews r good.But cons - 90% of the time, water drips when pouring water in.. (this absolutely drives me nuts cos we have oven and rice cooker next to it ).Also, coffee grounds are on the bottom..not that much but u can see them. .It will beep ( stating that it's over) 30-45 minutes after its finished..makes no sense lol.After making a pot of coffee and if I run out and make another one, when I pour in steam pops down ( really scary with the noise and heat ).This morning, brewed coffee just like any other day, for some reason half of it spilled on the counter and there's a burnt smell..I've never experienced coffee machine like this. I make my husband coffee daily... today we just gave up and he told me to buy a new coffee pot....I'd give it 0 stars but no option..Worst machine ever"
Raka,1.0,"May 23, 2017","Unfortunately, this came already busted - the first (and second, and third) time I tried to make a pot, the coffee leaked out everywhere, all over the heated surface directly below the pot, causing steam and sizzling noises, and all over the counter and floor. I'm not sure where the leak is even coming from, but it most certainly makes the product unusable. Definitely disappointed in the quality control in this deal. I know I was paying a lower price for a warehouse product, but this was straight-up unusable from the get-go."
Lee Morales,1.0,"October 18, 2016","Ordered on October 4, 2015 It stopped working right after it hit the one year mark. I have to believe it's designed to do that from the company. As for the coffee it makes? That's a suggestive question. Usually pretty good depending on the coffee I'm using. The brewing is on par with other coffee makers in this category so the bar is set pretty low for $30 bucks. I would have given it 4-5 start if it would only last longer than a year. I just re-ordered another ""Mr Coffee Disposable Coffee maker"" so see ya next year!"
Melissa D,4.0,"December 17, 2013","*still working fine in 2021*We have been using our new Mr. Coffee for several days now, and we are quite satisfied. After years of using a surprisingly problematic programmable Cuisinart, we were happy to ""downgrade"" to a simple, affordable, and reliable coffee maker. We have no complaints about pouring from the carafe, as others seem to, but we only make 10 cups at a time. 12 cups makes for an awfully full carafe, as we noted when cleaning the pot before first use. The coffee comes out nice and drinkably hot! We use the same amount of grounds as we did for the aforementioned Cuisinart, so that's been nice, too.It's a handsome machine with a small countertop footprint. I'm very pleased so far."
Banzai,4.0,"February 27, 2014","I bought this as a replacement coffee maker for work. It's easy to operate. It uses the same size filters and the exact same carafe as the older 12-cup Mr. coffee machine it replaces and you can set this coffee maker up to accept the 8-cup thermal carafe as an option.  There's better, fancier and more expensive coffee makers available but if you have an investment into bulk supplies on your old 12-cup Mr. Coffee this is a solid pick for the money.  Additionally, there is a 2-hour timer that shuts off the burner.  I personally like this feature but coffee grazers in my workplace don't like having to take the extra step of reheating their late coffee pours.  4*s"
Disappointed,3.0,"February 8, 2016","My Mr. Coffee stopped working after 7 months. If I had read more of the reviews from people who owned this Mr. Coffee for a few months rather than right after it was bought, I would have seen that others have had the same disappointing experience. Sadly I also bought this Mr. Coffee for my son. I will have to tell him to have a back up because he may find that one morning his Mr. Coffee will stop working, too.Update: After speaking to a very helpful representative at Amazon I spoke directly with the Mr. Coffee service department. Because my coffee maker was less than a year old, I will receive a replacement. If the replacement and my son's coffee maker continue to work, I will revise my previous review."
Katybug,5.0,"January 30, 2015","Nice little coffee pot.  Had a Bunn for years until it quit.  In the meantime, I had also been gifted with a Keurig.  We needed a pot for when company comes and we need to serve more people.  This one did the trick.  It takes way longer than the Bunn, obviously, but takes half as much coffee to brew a great cup of coffee.  It has a ""beeper"" that lets you know when the coffee is made and lets you also ""steal"" a cup while it is brewing if you get impatient.  Looks nice sitting on the counter.  In fact, it looks like an expensive coffee pot, and it isn't.  I would recommend."
flenzy,4.0,"March 14, 2016","I bought this Mr. Coffee as I have always counted on this brand.  I received it with a shattered (and I do mean shattered) carafe.  The glass is so thin on it!  Thank goodness I bought the metal container separately.  I tried to contact the seller, but never could find the one on the coffee machine to do so.  Anyway, be aware of the thinness of the carafe.  Shards were everywhere - the packaging  was overall very good, but I can see where a jolt in delivery could do this.  The machine is great to use otherwise."
Joshua Levinson,2.0,"January 29, 2016","Worked really well for about 7 months. Was happy with the programming feature especially, as I like to have my coffee brewed when I come into work. Everybody at work loved it and we used it a bunch.After only 7 months, the thing just stopped making coffee entirely. Light was on, ""brew"" light was on -- nothing. The warranty is apparently only 30 days, so too bad for me, I guess. Mr. Coffee's website recommended going to a ""Authorized Service Location."" Really? I'm gonna hire an electrician to fix my 30 dollar coffee maker?Frustrated and will most likely avoid Mr. Coffee products in the future. I'm guessing it'll be under some kind of warranty, but even if they do return the thing, it's a pain in my butt and the thing should really be expected to work for at least a year."
Laura Mushkat,2.0,"December 8, 2014","after getting and using the product I was surprised because my last Mr Coffee lasted 20 years and was great.  I went to their website thinking others might like it and was shocked at all the bad reviews on various types of Mr Coffee coffeemakers.there is not enough room to tell you what I do not like about this but after fooling arround with it I can now use it.  even the instructions I found were not that clear as they could be.I will use this till I feel the need and can afford a better make.  will ask people I know about their makers and brand as well as investigate various brands on the various sites, including Amazon."
EyesOnAllison,1.0,"September 19, 2016",Listen to the bad reviews of this coffee maker and DO NOT BUY IT!!  It worked a year and 4 days then quit on me.  My cheap coffee maker from a big box store lasted years and years until the heating element stopped heating properly.  This one worked yesterday and this morning just died.  It won't pump water or heat the hot plate beneath the pot.  You turn it on and it does nothing.  I had noticed my first cup of coffee wasn't as warm yesterday and then today it was no longer working.  Save your money and buy something else.
El Cohete,4.0,"November 12, 2013","It makes coffee.  It was very inexpensive.  I trust the name Mr. Coffee / Joe DiMaggio etc...  The coffee tastes as good as the coffee you use and the stuff you put in it.  Even my favorite coffee tastes like crap unless I put half and half or Coffee Mate creamer in it.  It won't make crap coffee taste delicious.The front face has some LEDs but has no lighted clock face, so you need to get your glasses and turn on every light in the room in order to see what you are doing when setting it up and setting timers etc..The button that selects between regular & strong does not seem to work and I see no difference in the coffee.  It would be nice if the owners manual said something like, ""selecting strong will make your coffee stronger by using hotter water, and/or a longer brew time"", but it does not so this feature is meaningless, when a lighted front face/clock would really have been useful.It's a good machine for the low cost.I liked the older versions better that had similar features and lights, but they seem to be discontinued models."
K&N,5.0,"December 28, 2019","Love this coffee maker! The coffee comes out excellent. Brews fast, hot, and awesome flavor. My first one broke after 5+ yrs and use it EVERYDAY. Replaced with the same exact model because I have been so happy with it. Highly recommended!"
James Kress,5.0,"June 26, 2013","I originally purchased this product because it was rated as one of the top Coffee Makers in Consumer Reports, and have not been disappointed.It is quick to brew, and brews nice and hot. I use it daily at work, so I appreciate the refined look of the stainless steel, which I think is done just right (not too much, and not too little). A great feature on this machine is a brew clock, that tracks how long the coffee has been sitting (up to two hours, then the burner turns off).Combine this with the permanent filter from Mr. Coffee, and you have a machine that never needs filters. Very convenient not to have to remember to buy them.I would highly recommend this as your next drip coffee maker!"

I really hope that this Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT Lasts me more than 2 years !! -- And yes -- all my other coffee makers were also Mr. Coffee's . ---- This one just seems well built . Easy to operate and my coffee hasn't tasted this good in a while . And now with my handy-dandy new Travel mug by Thermos - my mornings have been quite pleasant . Thanx Amazon !!
A. Stiles,5.0,"January 13, 2012","First off, my coffee tastes delicious!  All of those features at this price, plus it looks great on my countertop...just can't beat it.In regards to those comments about the smell...I didn't find it overwhelmingly powerful when I took it out of the box, but as a preventative measure I put it through three cycles before making my own coffee.  First clear water, then water with vinegar, then light roast to get the vinegary taste and smell out.  I don't really think this was a big deal at all.  After this, my coffee is the best I've had in a while.  I couldn't be happier.I use it with the Mr. Coffee GTF2-1 Basket-Style Gold Tone Permanent Filter, which is easier to clean than to have to deal with filters.  I highly recommend both these products."
Eugene G Mummert,5.0,"November 16, 2014",My old coffee pot gave up the ghost and suddenly died. Browsed the Amazon site and found this one that fit my needs. It is well constructed and  looks great in the kitchen. It is designed well and easy to operate. The timer and clock are easy to read and easy to set.The only negative comment I have is that there is an indicator light that lets you know if you are using the regular 12 cup pot or thermal carafe which is important if you switch back and forth between the 2 because the maximum water levels differ for the 2. Mine quit working after about 4 days but has no effect on my usage since I always use the 12 cup pot only.
Ben D. G.,4.0,"June 12, 2016","Coffee maker brews coffee that is to my liking and even uses less coffee grounds to achieve desired taste. The coffee maker has 2 short comings. The electrical cord is very short and the water overflows out of built in overflow hole at rear of water tank. Stupid engineering on that and more so on the lenght of the cord. Mr. Coffee stipulates that it is for my :"" Safety "". I say it is to watch their bottom line. Consumers gladly will pay an extra dollar for an extra 12 inches of electrical wire. Shame on you Mr.Coffee. Ben."
Marcia Gohman,4.0,"March 29, 2013","I LOVE this pot! I ordered it with the glass pot, and it makes just enough coffee to keep my hubby and I from fighting over the last cup - which is why I ordered this one!I find that I'm using about the same amount of grounds for this pot as I did for the old 8 cup I had before. This one allows me to specify a ""Dark"" brew or a ""Regular"" brew, and the dark brew is just perfect!It's easy to use and cleaning the caraffe is much easier than the metal one that stained and stayed stained. No matter what I did short of taking an SOS pad to it.My one complaint is that the clock is not lighted. I had no idea how much I used that little digital display on the old coffee maker! I find myself squinting at the display on this one. And at night, forget about it! If they fixed that one thing, this would be the best coffee maker I have owned in a while!"
Red,1.0,"May 30, 2016","Purchased this product in February 2016 and it is now May 30 2016.....so so so disappointed! I had this less than 6 months and it stopped working!! I thought this coffee maker was amazing, but boy was I wrong. Everything lights up and clicks when buttons are pushed, but won't make coffee anymore or heat the pot. I tried turning it off and on...unplugging and plugging back in the wall....getting on my hands and knees and saying a prayer to the coffee gods, but nothing would make it brew. It now makes a great clock!"
Anna Schiraldi,1.0,"October 8, 2015","This coffee maker has changed my mornings. I've been using a keurig for the past 4 years and it became so annoying to to fill up your own k cups with your favorite coffee -- especially when you like more than one cup in the morning. The delay setting on this is perfect because you can wake up with your pot of coffee all ready. So far, so good.UPDATE 1.28.16Have had this since last May and it recently just completely crapped out. Was great when it was working fine, but to wake up and it just stops working on morning is upsetting. Doesn't seem to be any internal issue that I can see...I guess you get what you pay for."
jax,5.0,"February 25, 2015","we've only had this for a few days but it works perfectly.  It did smell of plastic at first but after running two clean cycles, it seems to have dissipated.  Have not had any trouble with pouring --- it has been a dream in that regard.  And no backing up or overflowing at all. I'm still playing with the Normal/Bold button for coffee strength vs. the amount of coffee I actually use as my old Black and Decker didn't have this option and we needed to use more coffee than normal to get the bold flavor we wanted.  Will post again if there are any drawbacks."
G. Wilmes,2.0,"January 16, 2017","Within a couple months of purchasing, the hour button stopped working so we're unable to reset the clock or delay setting. But more frustrating is that the it doesn't read that we're using the glass decanter so the hot plate shuts off immediately after brewing and doesn't keep the coffee warm for very long. We contacted Mr. Coffee directly but never heard back. Spend a little more money for something that works...**UPDATE**Mr. Coffee did contact us back and sent a replacement...for free! Newer model even. I will continue to use Mr. Coffee products!"
Craig Balson,5.0,"February 13, 2015",I have not had any of the problems that some others have mentioned. Of course I am one of those people that reads instructions all the way through. If you follow the instructions there should be no problems. It tells you how to install everything properly and even gives tips to avoid the overflow problem some say they have experienced (which is filter related). One thing I make sure that I do too is make sure the drip spout is lined up with the glass pot correctly before brewing coffee. I love the advanced brewing setting. I set my maker up at night and it is brewing before I get up in the morning.
B. Robinson,1.0,"January 24, 2016","Sorry to say this item purchased on 12/04/2015 was dead by 01/24/2016.  Very disappointed.  And yes it did have the reported ""smell"" that never totally went away.  I was willing to overlook that, but can't overlook the fact that IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL anymore.  Just woke up to an empty pot after setting the delay brew the night before.  Can't get it to ""reboot"" to start working again.  Very disappointing.  Did I mention that already?"
Pat H.,3.0,"March 22, 2017","My experience with this coffee maker will cause me to no longer trust Consumer Reports.  I had nothing but trouble with this.  Almost immediately the ""ears"" on the carafe list broke off. Then the markings on the carafe wore off so I don't know how much water I am putting in.  Now the water doesn't come out of the hot water valve evenly so the the coffee is too weak. I guess you get what you pay for. My last Braun lasted 15 years. This one lasted 2.3 years"
Scott I. Gray,4.0,"December 19, 2014","Makes good coffee.  If you put it under a cabinet on the counter, buy a Copco Coffee Cab rolling appliance holder.  You can't pour water in it without pulling out from under cabinet every time.  I threw the filter away, it was more of a pain, and I really don't care about filtered water.  ( I drink out of the garden hose too.)  If you try to make half a pot of coffee with only one scoop of coffee, the pause and serve will drip every time.  I found that if I wait until it is completely done brewing, this won't happen.  If I make a full pot with two or more scoops of coffee, this doesn't seem to happen.  I can't read the tiny lights and clock without my glasses on, but have figured out which buttons to push to make the coffee, so no big deal.  Looks good on our counter, and makes pretty good coffee every time."
Double Beans,1.0,"January 22, 2016","So bummed. Loved the coffee. But I have had this less than 1 year and it already does not work. Turns on, does not brew. Tried everything. Less than a year having it that is horrible. I would probably give it 5 stars if it continued working because the coffee tastes great, works fast, perfect for me. But, I'm reviewing my product, not the product in general, and for that reason I give it one star. Maybe others will have better luck."
Michael MacKenzie,5.0,"March 4, 2016",Having the option to have a thermal coffee put is awesome. I got tired of my French press and wanted to go back to a drip coffee machine. I'll still use my French press just not as often.I forgot that with these machines you use more coffee to get that good flavor and that if you don't drink it fast enough it's burned tasting in an hour. Yuck!! So we also order the thermal pot and problem solved. Even if it gets colder faster it's way better to try and heat a cup from the thermal and burn that a little then the glass pot that's burnt to hell.Should also note that I bought the mr coffee reusable filter and the thermal pot.
"24-35 year old woman, intermountain west",2.0,"January 26, 2015","We are a two-person coffee-drinking household, and typically used this coffeemaker to brew an average of two pots a day. I purchased the coffemaker in March 2014, enjoyed it for ten months, bought a thermal carafe for the coffeemaker in December, and in January 2015 the coffeemaker stopped working. The pump has stopped efficiently delivering water to the grounds, the coffee brews much more slowly while mixing in too much air into the water being delivered to the grounds in the basket, and when the coffee maker 'thinks' that it is finished, there are at least a few cups of water remaining in the reservoir. It is broken! I wish we could replace the pump without trashing the whole coffeemaker, but it isn't obvious how that could be done. We did try running several cycles of diluted vinegar through the coffeemaker, and cleaned the part of the pump we could access with a pipe cleaner, but neither seemed to have any effect. Too bad! It was a nice coffeemaker for the ten months that it did work."
Tbest,5.0,"August 2, 2015","Love this thing! Not only does it work perfectly but it also looks a lot nicer then the majority of the coffee makers I was looking at in the same price range. The programmable start option in the morning is fantastic because honestly I'm too tired/lazy to start coffee right when I wake up. I just prep it after my morning cup for the next day and it's ready to go. My favorite feature though is having the option to select normal or strong brew, I love strong coffee so it is made making a stronger brew much easier."
Amazon Customer,2.0,"December 5, 2012","We were looking for a coffee maker made in USA. Apparently the Chinese have figured out how to illuminate the digital clock display, but alas, Mr Coffee has not. Anybody can make a simple drip coffee maker, but this is a no-brainer: You gotta be able to see the clock, especially for setting time-delay brewing. The clock display is in a recessed setting, with a grey background and black numbers, so it's especially hard to see without a flashlight. You'd think this would be a basic feature of any coffee maker, and for years that has been my experience...until I met Mr Coffee. We'll keep trying to find a decent made-in-usa product, but it could be the Chinese have a corner on that market!"
Sean C.,4.0,"August 27, 2016","We bought this after calculating how much we were spending with a Keurig. Drinking coffee frequently and making ice coffee too, the Keurig didn't make sense to keep. Looking around we didn't want to spend a lot of money on it's replacement. I've had the more expensive Cuisinart Grind N Brew makers but the grinders break. Instead we went inexpensive.The make is nice, a little plasticky looking but looks good. The spout on the coffee pot could be a little better to funnel the coffee and eliminate drips but overall it's not bad."
J. Mangum,1.0,"October 19, 2013","Bought to replace a very old Braun coffee maker.  Followed Consumer Reports recommendation suggesting that the Mr Coffee was a ""best buy"".  Unfortunately, it appears from reviews both here and on the CR web site that this coffee maker has serious manufacturing issues.  We found immediately that the strong brew setting did not work.  When selected the coffee maker would beep three times then brew a ""normal"" pot of coffee.  Contacted Mr Coffee customer support who responded that our coffee maker was defective and that we should return it.  That we did.This coffee maker is a definite ""do not buy"", in my opinion."
Victor H.,4.0,"April 27, 2015","For a cheap auto drip brewer I'm happy.  It works.  The controls are simple, and the timer and autobrew features are nice to have.  The spring-loaded stopper so you can pour a cup before finished is nice, but it *will* leak several drops every time.  Oh well, for the price I won't complain too much.The basket takes some fiddling sometimes to seat.  You need to make sure you really seat it or it will overflow and not drain into the carafe.It did have quite a chemically smell and taste initially.  I had to run several cycles of fresh water through to get rid of it."
ophtha wahl,2.0,"January 8, 2014","We bought our coffeemaker in August 2013.  It worked well.  We brewed coffee usually once a day, except when we travelled over Christmas.  Starting on New Year's Day, we got oodles of steam but about an inch of extremely strong coffee.  Then on the 7th -- Kaput!Since we have hard water, we thought it must be us.  But we'd cleaned it and the residue on the filters was not excessive.  After we decided to go buy a new pot, my son took it apart and said that it wasn't clogged, but seemed not to draw water up from the tank.  So I don't think it was our hard water; I think it has a design flaw."
Dunzo,1.0,"June 2, 2017",I have bought two of these in the last year and they have both quit working.  There is nothing more frustrating and surely criminal than waking up and not being able to make coffee because your Mr. Coffee maker decided to quit. Don't buy this unless you like to replace it every 6 months. Junk.
Carmelite Duhon,1.0,"October 13, 2014","I can't imagine why this coffee pot has gotten any good ratings!  The coffee tastes and smells like burned plastic.  My whole kitchen smelled so bad the first time I ran it that I had to turn on my stove vent.  I followed the set up and cleaning instructions, ran water through it several times before I tried coffee.  No luck.  I then went online and found a ton of people who had had the same problem!  I tried all of the advice I could find to fix the problem (ran vinegar through it, ran rubbing alcohol through it, used filtered water).  I must have run that machine 15 times with different things in it to try and change the taste. The plastic taste was ultimately reduced, but never went away.  Sending it back!!"
Amazon Stockholder,4.0,"November 3, 2012","I have only had this 2 days, but I am impressed with it's value and performance. I like the Brew Strength option and use it to make my stronger coffee. This unit also gives you the option of using an insulated carafe and there is a button to select between a glass carafe and an insulated. Note, the glass carafe will hold the advertised 12 cups, but the insulated carafe will hold 8 cups.The buttons are arranged nicely, and you can read the labels as they contrast nicely with the background. I have not used the Delay option, to make coffee at a particular time.Overall, for the money, this unit offers a lot."
John W.,5.0,"December 30, 2013","When our last coffee-maker died, we used the internet to identify the best and best-value coffee makers.This fills the bill on both counts.Makes up to 12 cups quickly, and at variable strengths.Timer is easy to set and reliable.Comes with an internal filter that is amazing in its ability to filter-out solids even when use a Pur water filter for the coffee.It is not unusual to see lime deposits on the filter; our water hardness varies with seasons and demand.It's sort of odd, but I feel proud to walk buy one of these on store shelves and see the top-quality bargain we got through Amazon.Excellent product at a great price."
nospam77,2.0,"January 26, 2014","I decided to replace my simple Braun with a model that included the feature to automatically start at a set time.  I figured with the large number of good reviews I couldn't go wrong with this Mr. coffee.  Even when I select the ""strong"" button it makes weaker coffee and it seems to be picking up a flavor from some rubber or plastic parts, just off.  Reasonably priced coffee makers with conical filters seem to have disappeared.  The new coffee maker looks nice and fits in with my decor.  but the old simple black Braun (no longer available) is going back on the counter and I'm chalking this up to a $30 mistake."
Gina Mora,5.0,"July 16, 2013","This is just what it says it is and it does come with a water filter but I have chosen not to use it as the water doesn't taste terrible where we live. I have tried it on both strength settings and I can tell the difference. I also used it to brew a pot of tea and surprisingly that turned out well too! I bought a Mr. Coffee GTF2-1 Basket Style Gold tone permanent filter to go with  it and it fits perfectly. Also, I found setting the time and the initial brew set up very easy. Only thing is the water filter fits over the basket is a funny way but no matter, it is a nice looking and well made coffee maker as far as I can tell thus far."
Pie R Square,4.0,"September 2, 2013","Product arrived on time, as ordered. Easy to set up. So far we've made 4 pots of coffee and the coffee maker works just fine. We chose to purchase this product based on recommendations from a consumer magazine. Don't have any major objections about the end result produced by the coffee maker. However, the coffee maker functions a lot slower than the appliance we were already using. Takes much longer to complete making coffee. We're not much on programming a timer for coffee, but for others this may be exactly the way to go. Although we've only made 4 pots of coffee, it is our opinion the finished coffee could be a bit hotter. Coffee makers become a personal thing and everyone has their own preferences. This coffee maker is an OK appliance, but we've decided to donate it to a grandson who is a college student."
Christmas Mom,2.0,"October 31, 2015","Worked great for 6 months and then died. :(  Lights on, but coffee not brewing.  Seems like there is no water in the reservoir, but there is.  I have cleaned it at least twice in 6 months with vinegar, so i don't believe anything is clogged.  The good thing is, Mr. Coffee is sending me a replacement since it's still under warranty.  The bad thing is, it won't be here for 6-8 days which is a long time to go without coffee! :)"
cassiet717,2.0,"October 14, 2013","We got this coffee maker after our last Mr. Coffee quit, and it's the last Mr. Coffee I'll ever buy. It works fine, carafe doesn't spill, mechanics are great - but the coffee isn't. I have no idea why, but there is just no flavor in the coffee made with this coffee maker. I've tried brewing it strong (a nice feature) and switching from our tried-and-true favorite coffee to different roasts to get a stronger and better flavor, but something about this maker just makes bland coffee. It's a nice little machine with convenient options and features, but I'd prefer one with no bells and whistles that just makes decent coffee!"
The Saint,5.0,"November 30, 2013","I have been a long time Cuisinart coffeemaker lover and after being disappointed with their latest coffeemaker, I decided to go with this Mr. Coffee maker and I have been elated ever since purchasing it.  I love coffee, plain and simple, and equated a higher-priced coffee maker to a good cup of coffee and I was wrong.  This coffee maker is easy to operate and clean and it makes a great cup of coffee day-in and day-out.  The temperature of the coffee is hot, brews a very consistent cup, and has all of the bells and whistles anyone could want from a coffee maker.  You won't be disappointed in this product."
Jason Belt,3.0,"August 30, 2016","I purchased this over two years ago and overall I'd say it's an okay coffee maker.  My biggest complaint with this one, and in fact most Mr. Coffee makers, is the design of the 'sneak a cup' feature where you can remove the pot while it is still brewing.  When the pot is placed in the maker the lid presses on a spring in the coffee basket which allows the brewed coffee to flow into the pot.  However, if the pot isn't pushed all the way to the back of the maker then the spring won't be engaged so coffee will overflow the basket and start pouring over the sides.  When that happens about 20% of the coffee will make it into the pot but the rest will end up on the counter, in the drawers, and on the floor.  That's a terrible way to start your day."
ImJustAvg,1.0,"December 23, 2015","Received the package at 0600 on Dec 23!  Unfortunately, even before I opened the Mr Coffee box, I knew there was a problem!  The box I had received had been opened and even had a return sticker on it!  Although it looked new it wasn't clean inside!  Applied for a refund and was approved!  But decided to power it up and see if the unit worked!  Although the unit powered up and all the right lights came on - it would not pump up water so was dead on arrival!"
SAP,2.0,"December 30, 2013",It still works but the coffee is no longer hot.  It never did brew very hot but now it's just warm right after you pour it out of a freshly brewed pot.  The program controls quit working correctly after about a year and the beeper would go off saying the coffee was done brewing when you could clearly hear it still dripping.  A little expensive for a coffee maker that only lasted two years.  I had a real old Mr. Coffeemaker model before this with no features.  Just a plain coffee maker that lasted for years and worked well until the day I put it away.  It was white.  I bought a new home with stainless steel appliances so decided to buy this current model that had good ratings and matched my kitchen but it turned out to be a sorry coffeemaker that never did make very hot coffee.
Axemann,2.0,"November 19, 2014","Farewell to Mr Coffee.  We bought this in April 2013, and it's pretty much on it's last leg.  Although we have followed the care and cleaning requirements, the coffee leaks all over the place from time to time.  It's hit or miss.  So instead of watching our coffee maker make coffee, we decided to buy a fairly highly rated Hamilton Beach which arrived today.  We have purchased 2 other Mr Coffee makers in the past 10 years and with each purchase, we have noticed a decline in the quality and longevity of each machine.  Too bad, but now we're moving to another brand with the hope of better luck."
MNgrrrl,5.0,"December 9, 2014","We replaced a much more expensive Krups model with good old Mr. Coffee - the Krups carafe was poorly design and spilled unless your poured the coffee with extreme care. We're able to pour this easily, no spills. It's easy to load and looks nice. We were able to get the delayed brew settings into place with no problem. It comes with a filter that is supposed to filter the water as it come out of the heating tube and goes down through the coffee - we couldn't see that it did anything, so it went to the garbage. Other than that, this does exactly what it needs to do."
David W. Stewart,4.0,"November 7, 2011","So far (and our experience of only week is why I rate it only 4 stars rather than 5) this has been a good purchase for us.  I've had none of the bad experiences reported by others (e.g., plastic taste in the coffee).  The coffee has been uniformly good.  It is a little awkward to prepare coffee on our counter that is partially covered by a cupboard.  The cap of the coffeemaker won't fully open if the machine is under the cupboard so it is necessary to pull it out first, but with the top open the cupboard door won't open.  So I must remember to first open the cubbard, fill the basket, close the cupboard, then open the coffeemaker top and pour in the water.  No big deal but it takes longer than was necessary with our old machine.  Also I have to turn the machine to the side and bend down to read the fill markers on the water container.  However, I don't consider any of these to be major problems.  The coffee is good.  That's what counts."
D. L. Mason,3.0,"May 15, 2013","Just like the 3 stars says, It's okay.  Years ago I heard that Mr Coffee made a fast cup of coffee, just not very good. I thought by now there would have been enough feedback that they would have improved, maybe they have but I am still trying to figure outhow to get a good cup of coffee from my Mr Coffee maker.  I've tried it with and without the water filter, I don't have city water, just good well water.  It does seem to taste better with filter, maybe it slows the brew water down enough that it uses all the grounds more efficiently.  Maybe I'll hit the magic mix one of these days, it could be I had an old bag of coffee.  It does look nice with all that chrome trim.  I read where some folks had a problem with the coffee tasting like plastic.  I washed everything with warm soapy water, then ran a pot full of plain water through it, then a pot full of water with a 1/4 cup of white vinegar, then a pot full of plain water.  No plastic smell or taste."
Joe E,3.0,"November 16, 2018","It's just a matter of time before coffee grounds fall into the water hopper and reduce or completely stop water flow to the heating element. I have purchased 5 of these makers over the years. Sometimes I would go 18 months, sometimes less. Each time I promised myself to be more careful because when the maker is working correctly it does make good coffee and the price is reasonable. However, the design is destined to fail, and you too will have the same problem."
Mac Harris,2.0,"October 13, 2016","I know it isn't commercial grade but I expected more than 14 months. Lights still come on, but no heat, no water from the reservoir. Actually failed in mid-operation. just out of warranty by 2 months, 9 days. Timing is everything!!The Mr. Coffee was less than expected, but the Asurion 2 year extended warranty was well worth the minimal cost.No hassle return and reimbursement, I recommend this to anybody buying any product it is offered on."
M. Blank,5.0,"May 24, 2013","I generally use my single cup espresso maker, but when we have a group it is not very practical.  When I learned my in laws were coming for an extended visit I wanted an actual coffee maker.  I did research and found this rated well.  It works perfectly.  It is super easy to set up with very user friendly features.  I love the programmable feature, so it was ready for whoever woke first and especially the auto shut off - yes, I always forget to turn it off.  It also does a good job of keeping the coffee warn throughout the two hours.  I'm very happy with this coffee maker, especially since it is reasonably priced."
Cedarlila,2.0,"December 11, 2016","it says it's programmable in the description, but that is misleading and false. It is not programmable, you can only set a delay timer. I don't want to have to stand there at night when I'm sleepy trying to figure out how many hours to 'delay' it for. I want to be able to pick a time in the morning and when I wake up, have coffee waiting! I bought this for the programming function, rather than a manual pot for cheaper, and I feel ripped off."
Robert C. Stich,5.0,"January 13, 2012","I bought this mostly because Consumer Reports gave it a ""Best Buy"" review.  It's one of the cheapest and works beautifully.  One thing that surprised me is that there was a significant difference in the flavor of the coffee over our old Mr. Coffee that was wearing out.  We usually use Yuban or a house coffee - nothing very expensive.  Since we've had this new coffee maker, we use the ""strong brew"" option.  Even though it has still been the same big can of coffee grounds, this brewed coffee is way better - much more flavor than we'd been getting.The timer feature works perfectly, too.  We're very pleased and I can't see any reason to buy a more expensive maker."
Crazy about Coffee,5.0,"March 14, 2013",After reading reviews mentioning there being a plastic smell I hesitated to buy this Mr. Coffee.  I decided to take a chance since I have had success with previous Mr. Coffees.  It arrived timely land in good condition.  After conditioning and cleaning it thoroughly I used the programs feature to make a pot of coffee to be ready in the morning.  It was easy to clean and program and worked like a dream.  When I got up my coffee was ready and there was no plastic smell or taste.  The coffee was just the way I like it.  I am so glad that I decided to order this Mr. Coffee. It is everythihng that I wanted in a coffee maker.
Dmitri T.,2.0,"October 24, 2013","The coffee maker looks great and it is probably reliable, but when I compare it to Cuisinart DCC-1200, there is a big difference in the the coffee taste. For the experiment I take the same amount of coffee and the same amount of water, but what Mr. Coffee produces appears to be about half as strong (i.e. diluted) as compared to Cuisinart. The difference is not so significant if you brew the full capacity (12 cups), therefore this coffee maker is probably OK for big groups of coffee drinkers. At home I usually brew just four cups for me and my wife, and therefore I consider Mr. Coffee a waste of money."
Chelle :),2.0,"September 10, 2016","If you are a heavy coffee drinker, I would recommend that you purchase a different system.  I have had more overflows already than I've had with any other pot. We have had it a couple months. If you do not get the pot exactly centered, you will have a mess inside the water tank, the coffee pot and warmer, and your countertop. The price is fair and I like the looks. I would not purchase it again."
Ed Jones,2.0,"January 11, 2016","Works fine. Meaning it does make coffee and is hot but do not expect more than that. The plate is really hot and burns the coffee in just a few minutes. You need to set the clock every time is plugged in. So, if you are like us that do not like seeing things on the countertop when are not in use, you must set the clock again every time. Not practical if you like to have something programmed. Of course you also need to reenter the program... For the cost is difficult to expect s lot more but I would not buy one again."
Woofs4,5.0,"August 21, 2015","Durable, is serious about its job & does it well. I would like it if I could clean the ""water well"" more thoroughly (that's a problem with every single coffee maker though. And I don't understand why the heating plate gets scratched no matter what you do. In the past I thought it was because I used the ""scrubbie"" side of the sponge, but this time I made sure I didn't use it at all & it still happened ... why then does it still get scratched??I would definitely buy again & would recommend to a friend."
KAteS,4.0,"November 14, 2014","Great coffee maker once you run water through it SEVERAL times!!! Out of the package, it has a very strong plastic smell that remains after running several pots of water through it.  The directions say that it is fine to make coffee after you run hot water through first, but the first pot of coffee I made after doing so had such a strong plastic smell that I dumped it out.  I hate to waste coffee, but I didn't feel safe drinking coffee that smelled like plastic!  Now, 2 months later, it makes a great pot of coffee with no drips and no more plastic smell."
B.C.,5.0,"May 9, 2012","So far this machine has performed well. Does a 6 to 7 min brew at 190ish degrees which is supposed to be the proper extraction parameters. Kicks out great tasting coffee. But then again, I usually use only freshly roasted and ground beans. Would probably even make decent coffee with bargain bin grounds.My only complaint is that it should come with one of their ""Gold-tone permanent filters"".All in all I am very satisfied as this machine brews as well or better than competitors that cost 2 or 3 times as much. If you pick the right model, Mr. Coffee is the way to go for someone who wants the most bang for their buck."
K. Fitz,4.0,"August 7, 2013","this coffeemaker works just fine - you don't really need a lot of things on a coffee maker in my mind - you need cold water and good coffee to start with - the machine should just deliver it hot from that;>) A small minor thing (aren't those the ones that usually bother you!) is that when it starts brewing it beeps - Like the beep I am use to hearing when the coffee is ""finished"" brewing or the heating element is turning off - Even though i have had the product for over two months, I keep hearing the beep and thinking it's done.Anyway - a good machine for a good price from a good name!"
Lacy,4.0,"October 15, 2013","Mr Coffee makes nice coffee makers...Does a good job, makes coffee quickly. Controls are easy to see and the machine is simple to operate. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is I don't like the coffee filter system. I use filtered water anyway, so why spend more money buying extra filters for this thing, which are expensive to buy.  I suppose it might be ok for people who have nasty hard water. Anyway, had I realized this coffee maker used filters, I wouldn't have bought it. If the filter isn't an issue for you, i say purchase this coffee maker and enjoy it."
Divine Mmnt,4.0,"June 18, 2019",I love this coffee maker. I had one before but stopped working after 4 yrs. Could not find another until now. Love that I can see timer and that I can choose strength of coffee. Only issue is thermal carafe has to be ordered separately. Still it is not a biggie for me. I 💘 this machine!
Scarson,1.0,"December 4, 2015","horrible product, lasted for one month and then started sputtering steam, almost burning my hands and all the water started spewing OUTSIDE the coffee pot and then it clicked off. Now when I plug it in, the lights turn on and NOTHING happens, no matter how many buttons I push or try to reset it. Horrible quality, I know its cheaper, but seriously, a month?"
Denice S. Molen,2.0,"July 12, 2015","It works!!! Easy to use, makes coffee fast and hot.  We bought a more expensive coffee pot 2 years ago, lesson learned just because it costs ,ore does not mean it is a better product.  This coffee pot is reasonably priced and works great.  Would recommend to anyone.  UPDATE!!!!  Just stopped working in the middle of brewing a pot of coffee. Have had less than 4 months.  hoping Mr Coffee is easy to work with on getting a replacement since they guarantee 1 year on defects."
SoCal Fun,1.0,"March 18, 2015","Warming platform peels and corrodes within 1 month.  Poorly made.Upon an exchange of emails with the vendor, the original machine was replaced, the new machine has now stopped working within 7 months of the replacement unit - lights light but nothing happens.  Emailing the vendor has not met with any response after their contention that all emails are returned within 3 business days.  Do not buy Mr. Coffee products if you'd like to just have great coffee and not an intimate and not necessarily pleasant relationship with the vendor."
DixieLady,2.0,"November 26, 2013","I purchased this after several Cuisinart models and other brands, after reading favorable reviews from Amazon buyers as well as one from a leading consumer magazine.  I am sorry to report my disappointment in this Mr. Coffee machine.  The water filter provided is awkward in its placement and I stopped using it after I kept getting grounds in the coffee.  Also, regardless of whether I use the regular or strong brew strength option the coffee is quite weak.  Next time I will spend the extra bucks to purchase a higher end machine."
PTG,3.0,"March 28, 2018","OK.  Easy to use.  BUT, the heating plate RUSTS quickly, thereby looking awful, making rough sounds when you side the decanter in/out, and probably not making the best contact with the decanter to keep it warm.  Seems to be no way to avoid this rust issue.  We've owned three of these coffee makers and had the same problem, repeatedly, despite careful efforts to avoid it."
Hello People!,5.0,"January 14, 2017","Purchased for Christmas 2015 and as of 1/14/2017 it is still working perfectly.  I had no idea my wife had picked this up on Amazon.

We use it daily and absolutely love it!"
likesgoodthingsthatwork,5.0,"January 5, 2014","Not sure what more you could ask for if you brew simple drip coffee? This was very highly rated by Consumer Reports at a much higher price. At this price, this product is hard to beat.There is a dash of ""stainless like plastic"" to be able to tie this product in to a black or stainless appliance kitchen.One thing I missed - or just assumed - during purchase was the fact that this unit  DOES NOT have a permanent filter. We are currently using up some old paper filters but will ultimately spend the few bucks to get a permanent gold mesh filter."
Clarapatra,1.0,"July 18, 2016","Product worked fantastically for about 6 months, then stopped working mid-brew one day.Technically I'm still under warranty but if you're an avid coffee drinker like me, you know going without a coffee maker for 2 weeks while everything is being shipped is not really an option - I'd be out buying coffee every day and end up spending the same amount of money it takes to just buy a new coffee maker.Overall, it looks nice on the kitchen counter, and it works well, but seeing that this is a common complaint, this coffee maker is not built to last."
Raina,5.0,"July 26, 2014","The people posting about a plastic taste did not read the instructions.  You should brew one or two times with water before using this product (it says this in the manual).  This is a great value product actually.  I can set the brew on a delay if I want to wake up to coffee in the morning, and I only need to press one button in order to start the brew process.  It comes with a filter for the water that is used, which is a nice feature.  I just brewed two batches for the first time today using it and they tasted great.  I would recommend this to anyone as a good coffee machine."
L. Claude,1.0,"August 12, 2015","I've had Mr. Coffee's since the 70's...this one replaced one that was probably 20 years old.  I bought it in April.. it has been a problem since the first use..it kept getting coffee grounds in the pot...I thought I must be doing it wrong, not filling it properly, putting the filter in incorrectly.. something.  so I would clean it out and start again.  Well today August 12 (same year) it died.  The last pot it made the filter over flowed and got grounds in the pot... got grounds in everything really, under the filter holder, where you put the water, everwhere.  It cost about 40 bucks, no big deal, but now I think I would have paid the 40 not to have to use it.  Sad really, Joe DiMaggio would be so disappointed."
punkinsoul,1.0,"May 26, 2016","We have previously had relatively bad luck with our purchases of coffee makers, but they've always lasted at least a year of one.  This one, however, beats our record for quitters.  We purchased it the first of November last year and it is now the end of May, so it bit the dust in less than six months.  The extra insult is that we opted to go with a *better* coffee maker with added features, so it cost more.  For all that, it's now a shiny piece of junk."
S. Smith,5.0,"November 11, 2015","A nice looking coffee maker, simple to operate.  A small thing, but I like that it never drips when I pull out the carafe.  For some reason the sound of splashy spillage when I go to pour a cup annoys me greatly.  Seems that most coffee makers lose several drops even well after the pot has brewed.  Why?!  I don't know.  But this one doesn't, and it gets at least several stars for that.  It is well-designed, I love the retro look, and the black with silver matches all my other appliances.  Yay."
Chris B.,5.0,"May 18, 2014","This coffee maker satisfied many expectations; to make coffee, vary the strength, offer a large-capacity carafe, set the time to brew the night before, and told the time. It even gave me the option of replacing the glass carafe with an aluminum one, which the unit can detect! The aluminum carafe is sold separately, and does not offer the same capacity as the glass unit, but it does allow you to brew a pot and keep it warm without burning over time. They also include a charcoal filter that sits atop the brew basket. I'm not sure I'll keep that, because I haven't noticed a difference in taste with or without it in place. Overall, very satisfied with this unit."
MamaSama,4.0,"September 10, 2014","So far, so good.  I'd had the previous model for many years and upon its demise, this had the best reviews.  My only complaint thus far?  The strong brew button is no longer something you can set and leave.  Every time you make a pot, you'd better remember to hit it to make sure it's on. - Although I have the glass carafe, another feature that this one has is the ability to allow you to change to a thermal carafe.  Once you enter it onto the machine, it will turn off the heater at the bottom of the pot.  I may get the thermal pot...later."
Grandpa,3.0,"April 27, 2016","It's really better than OK, what the three stars says, but I don't understand why they put a clock on it when you can't see it, even in the light.If you look at the clock in the picture, you can't hardly even see it.  When you buy it, you can't even see it that well.  If you're going to put a clock on something, make it visible.There should have been one simple L.E.D.  in it."
Colleen J. Reiland,1.0,"May 30, 2016","I have to give it a star, but I wish I could give it 0. We bought this 8 months ago. The coffee pot turns itself off, or we turn it off with the button, and yet the burner still runs hot. Like SUPER hot. Like, I'm afraid it will burn down my house, hot. It will not turn off even if the machine is completely off. It will not go off after the two hour automatic shutoff. We have to unplug the machine every time we are done using it... Which really stinks if you want a programmable coffee pot. This is one of the most unsatisfactory purchases I've made on Amazon and probably one of the most disappointing coffee pots I've ever owned."
Cheryl,1.0,"July 12, 2016","Ive been meaning to write a review on this ever since I got it, but we were in the process of moving so I've been super busy. Anyways here is my Review....I haven't even owned this thing for a year and I hate it!! This is by far the WORST coffee pot ever!! It takes 45 min to brew a pot of coffee and it seems to be getting slower. I couldn't even bring myself to sell this to someone for a $1.00 without feeling like i ripped them off. Don't waste your money. Buy a Bunn."
Donald Edwards,5.0,"December 17, 2014",Makes really good coffee. I would also recommend buying the drd95 8-cup stainless steel double-walled thermal carafe for the coffee maker. These two make a great combination for more than one good cup of fresh coffee. Nothing tastes worse than coffee heated hours long. And this machine is much easier than the one cup machines. Imagine if you have 6 people there who want coffee. With this machine you can give everyone a cup at the same time. Other coffee machines just do not make as good coffee as this one. It is the best.
T. Vaughan,1.0,"August 17, 2016","After 2.5 months, the unit stopped brewing.  The clock and controls seem to work, but it just won't brew.  The filter container is properly set, the pot is properly set and there is movement in the ""pause and serve"" mechanism.  Everything worked just fine every day until a couple of days ago.  Of course, the unit is outside of the return policy now and there are no service centers in my area.  What a mistake. Mr. Coffee isn't the company it used to be.........I have owned several over a couple of decades.  Now that I have been ""burned"", I will seek out another manufacturer."
Cookie Baker,2.0,"June 28, 2013","I chose this brand based on ratings, having never had a Mr. Coffee product.  The filter basket broke when washed prior to first use, and when I called the customer service dept. at Mr. Coffee, they explained without hesitation that the basket could not be fixed (the spring and assembly had come out).  A new one was sent from the basket manufacturer in about 10 days, free of charge, and was satisfactory.  The basket is a very tricky/touchy fit and has caused an overflow several times in the last month of use.  Water doesn't seem to drip out of the filter basket fast enough and, consequently, we get some overflow grounds in our coffee pot.  Also, the ""pause and pour"" feature does not work.  Have tried it twice and had coffee all over the hot plate.  I have been making coffee for about 45 years with various brands of makers, so I am not a young ""newbie"" trying to operate Mr. Coffee.  Would not recommend this brand and will not be buying another.  Better to spend the money for a good quality coffee maker."

Laura,4.0,"July 20, 2012","I dunno. I've never owned any fancy coffeemakers so I guess you can keep that in mind here, but if you're looking for an inexpensive coffeemaker that does exactly what it says it'll do, this is it. The auto-shutoff feature had me because I obsessively worry about whether I turned off the coffeepot after I've left the house. The beep after brewing is a tiny bit annoying but I got used to it and I guess it's a good way of letting me know my coffee's ready in case I forget. As if I weren't already dragging around the house waiting impatiently for it to be done brewing."

I guess for the price, we got a good deal."
Russ,2.0,"April 18, 2016","It worked fine for about 9 months.  Sure, the over-fill prevention meant water all over my countertop, and sure, the lack of a temperature adjustment was annoying, but it was tolerable.  It made coffee when I wanted it to do so.However, after a recent power outage, I reset the clocks - the main and the delay timer - and now it refuses to work *except* on delayed brew, and even then the heating plate doesn't function at all.This is the first Mr. Coffee product in the past 25 years I've ever had a problem with, which is the only reason I'm not giving it only one star."
C. Crean,2.0,"November 30, 2015",Made of cheap plastic. Opened box took out filter cartridge and found it to be way out of round. Either manufacture defect or it sat in a hot warehouse and got out of shape. Then the ring that holds the date reminder broke off in my hands 20 seconds later. Not a good start. I'll see how the coffee is in the morning. This one may be going back.
Breezy,4.0,"July 26, 2016","Our Biggest issue are the Water Filtration Disk & Frame (Details) [...] IF you don't remember to put it back on the basket - it gets coffee grounds and water everywhere but where it needs to go.I cannot train my office mates to remember to air out the disk so it doesn't mold, nor can I convince them it has to be changed at least every other month. Wish I could get a machine like this that didn't require that dang disk!"
E. Nairod,4.0,"May 9, 2012","For taste, this coffeemaker would get five stars. It's the best, smoothest-tasting coffee I've ever experienced from a home coffeemaker, including French presses.Now the annoyances: When I first got it, the interior smell of plastic was strong and several runs of water didn't do much to diminish it. Even now, nearly a month later, I can still smell the plastic a bit. I do *not* taste the plastic in the brewed coffee itself. And I tend to be very sensitive to plastic smells, so I'm fairly confident about that.The interior area doesn't dry easily. If you like it to be dry so you can leave ground coffee overnight without diminishing the nice aromatic compounds with moisture, you're out of luck. I choose to grind mine fresh each morning, instead, which is always good choice anyway.This last quirk isn't that important... Unlike my previous Cuisineart coffeemakers, if you put N cups of water in, as measured by the gradient on the maker itself, you will get N-1 cups out. The measurements don't take into account the amount of water soaked up by the grounds. I have yet to make 12 cups of coffee, but I'm not sure if I should go over the max line on the container in order to get exactly 12 cups in the carafe.If this one broke today, I'd buy the same model again. Annoyances aside, the coffee is great."
luella butler,5.0,"January 23, 2014","My wonderful Mr. Coffee crashed and I was devastated as I liked it better than any coffee maker I have ever had. So I checked on Amazon and lo and behold......exact model I had had.......on sale, and Prime!  Can't beat that! Not only that....2 day shipping, right before Christmas.  It was delivered exactly then, and with Prime the shipping was free. I also had a little bit of reward money left, so my entire adventure cost me just over $12.00.  What fun.....to get another one of my favorite appliances for such a great deal.  I am one happy traveler."
maggienh,1.0,"January 16, 2012","I decided to purchase this coffee maker because our Cuisinart's carafe decided to spring a major leak and the coffee wasn't tasting so good any longer.  Rather than replace the carafe, we decided on a new machine. Prior to this, we were using a BUNN but didn't care for the machine being on all the time to keep the water hot.I read all of the reviews on this Mr. Coffee and figured that between us we could deal with all the design quirks.  We also assumed that the manufacturer would have eliminated the burning rubber/plastic odor after so many complaints.  What a mistake that was!  You could smell it as soon as it came out of the box and it's definitely inherent in the plastic used in the unit.  I cleaned it with vinegar numerous times, coffee maker cleaner, everything imaginable. Hot water, cold water and I even let everything ""air out"" by leaving the cover open and disassembling the components.  Dishwashing didn't help at all.  This was not a little odor but could recognized just walking into my kitchen.Now to the coffee.  It was absolutely horrible!  The taste passed right through to the brew and no matter what we did, it was undrinkable.  Now you've got to believe me when I say, this chemical or whatever it is simply can't be good for you! It's the same toxic smell you get from some foreign products....I think you know what I mean.So, after a short time, I was getting ready to return and found that the box had already been disposed of.  To end the ordeal, the machine was tossed out too. It was not worth the hassle for $39.  Don't buy this machine....the chemicals are NOT what you want in your cup of coffee."
Debbie,5.0,"September 10, 2016","The coffeemaker makes good coffee. I'm not sure how some don't. And it keeps the coffee hotter than most. My husband has gotten rather vigorous in cleaning it and twice it has quit working. If yours ever quits working, set it aside for a week - seriously, 4 days was not enough after the last soaking with the spray nozzle. It took a week to dry out but now it is operating like new.  We purchased it in early 2014."
Love 2 Cook,3.0,"April 16, 2012","I'm somewhat disappointed with this coffeemaker.Pros: easy to use filter system; easy to fill water tank.Cons: coffee is not hot enough; strong brewing cycle is not strong enough; coffee pot leaks when trying to pour the first cup, but does not leak after the first cup has been poured. It's just annoying.I would probably recommend this coffeemaker, but I'd mention all the cons along with my recommendation. The electrical cord is plenty long enough for me. I've noted that others have said it's too short. Maybe Mr. Coffee fixed the cord length since those posts."
JoAnn Pinkerton,5.0,"January 25, 2020",I have had this coffeemaker for over 2 years now and I am still pleased with it!  I'm fact I talked my friend into buying one and she also loves hers.

Chen Yuxiang,2.0,"October 22, 2015","I brought this coffee machine because of the the incredible amount of reviews and low price. This machine does have some plastic smell when you use it first several times, but the smell fade away after several uses. You can't really blame it anything for it's price.  However, after half month, it's stop working. I press the start button, LED lights up, and water wasn't heat up. It seems like the internal circuit was burned or something.(I didn't do anything wrong). So I contact Amazon, they sent me a new one with 2 day shipping. I hope the second one won't break up again. Half month lifetime is too short."
Traveler,5.0,"March 7, 2014","We are coffee lovers and go through coffeemakers about ever two or three years. We figure if we have to replace often, we'd go with a less costly product this time around. Have tried several brands (even commercial) in home. Finally decided to go back to Mr. Coffee.  Hope this one will last without a fractured water container, broken hose, burned out element, etc. Miss the four-hour keep warm cycle and 14 cup capacity on another brand, but this has a smaller footprint and makes a decent cup. Packaged well and arrived on time."
Imaeya,5.0,"January 30, 2014","I'm not too sure what people were complaining about a certain plastic smell after they had brewed coffee, but I certainly didn't have this problem. Sure after coming out of the box there was a plastic smell, so I cleaned everything, brewed a vinegar solution to go through the machine and then rinsed. After cleaning and making brewed tea with this beast, I couldn't smell or taste any plastic.It's a coffee maker for anyone who wants to brew up some coffee or tea. Nothing super fancy but it works and does it well."
Christina L.,1.0,"December 5, 2016",Update:Died after 18 months... won't draw up water and the hot plate is completely rusted.At first I loved this coffee pot. It's fairly quick for the drip method and it makes the coffee hot. It's easy to start and has a bold feature.  What disappointed me was that the heating plate started to rust very early. And now that it's been a year since I bought it it's completely rusted.

Michael M,1.0,"December 23, 2013","After having a Braun and a Cuisinart for a long time they both wore out. I decided to try this low cost Mr. Coffee coffee maker. It seemed to have all the features that I wanted and was less than half the price of the other high end coffee makers. I also liked the thermal carafe feature of this model.  I'm now on my second coffee maker, a replacement of the first and it still does not work like advertised or listed in the instruction manual. This one will be going back too but this time for a refund. I'll be purchasing a higher priced coffee maker. You do get what you pay for in this instance.Here is the problem with this coffee maker. The ""Strong Brew"" feature does not work. When using the glass carafe and it is placed in the ""Strong Brew"" mode, it will brew for about 30 seconds and then beep 3 times and both the ""Strong Brew"" and the ""Regular Brew"" lights will go out, but it does complete the brew cycle. You don't know what is really happening with the brew cycle. When using the thermal carafe and placed in the ""Strong Brew"" mode it will brew for 30 seconds, beep 3 times and then shut off. It is supposed to brew in either mode. It is also supposed to keep the last setting in memory until power is removed. This does not work either. This is obviously a defect in the function of this coffee maker.I contacted Mr. Coffee technical support after I noticed this defect in the first coffee maker. The support person was less than helpful and did not know how it was supposed to operate. I guess they could not read their own instruction booklet or advertisements. They wanted to ship me a different model to replace this one but the one they wanted to send did not support the thermal carafe. For some reason this model is no longer available directly from Mr. Coffee. The thermal carafe is one of the main reasons that I purchased this model. Somehow I'm getting the feeling that there were issues with this model and it was discontinued.I contacted Amazon for a replacement of this defective model and quickly received it. Unfortunately it functions exactly as the first which I described above. I'm going to return this one too and get something else and it definitely will not be another low end Mr. Coffee!There are several other things that I did not like about the coffee maker.- The auto shutoff is 2 hours and is not adjustable. If there is less than one quarter pot left it will start to burn and really smell bad.- The temperature of the carafe on the keep warm feature is too hot and causes the coffee to burn. Most good coffee makers allow you to adjust the temperature.- You have to use Mr. Coffee's expensive water filters for the coffee to brew properly. Without the filter being set on top of the brew basket, the water shower head squirts a small stream into the same corner of the brew basket. The filter distributes this squirt over the filter basket. We use R/O water and do not need the filter but it will NOT brew properly without it being in place.Since the coffee maker does not even function as advertised, let alone the other design problems, I could never recommend this coffee maker."
Easy Listening,5.0,"June 14, 2014","We saw that this product was highly rated in Consumer Reports for making good tasting coffee, and a much better buy price wise.  Ours came with the filtration system which is optional to use, but extremely easy.  Very happy with this product!They recommend changing the filter, each month, if you use the filters.  We ordered a pack of 6 filters thru Amazon....saves you quite a bit of money rather than ordering thru the Mr. Coffee website....there are different filters that look similar so just be sure you order the correct ones!"
Rheannin,3.0,"November 1, 2013","Machine is okay, but I wish Mr. Coffee could design a pot that doesn't drip all over the counter and down the mug EVERY time you pour. No matter how fast or how slow you go, you'll need a paper towel to go with your coffee mug. Also, coffee stays fresh for about 1/2 hour, then the hot plate makes it taste burned. I've had other brands that can keep coffee staying fresh tasting all morning. It's a good cheap machine if you are going to brew and take your coffee and turn it right off, and you don't mind cleaning up spills."
Kati B.,4.0,"July 27, 2013","Purchased this and the first one quit working after a few months. Amazon replaced it quickly and with no hassle. I like the side walls, it helps assure that the pot goes in correctly, I can also program it it brew when I need it, and it turns off by it's self. Which is one thing I have to have because I'm constantly forgetting to turn it off as I rush off to work. You should also just go ahead and order the GTF2-1 coffee filter with it. No more paper filters and it is easy to rinse out and toss in dishwasher. "" Save a tree"""
Book Maven,4.0,"September 9, 2014","Bought this a few weeks ago to replace a Sunbeam that had a cracked glass carafe.  The features on this are nice but the coffee is not as hot as it should be.  That is whether I pour a cup while it's still brewing or it has finished brewing.  My former cheaper machine made hotter coffee.  I also haven't found the correct coffee to water ratio, 2 cups of water to 1 heaping T seems too strong and with less it seems the coffee is too weak.  Not as great as the customer reviews seem to indicate and I'm disappointed."
ARL247,5.0,"February 11, 2014","After setting for a strong brew and starting the brew cycle the unit beeped three times and the Strong light went out. I spoke with the manufacturer who said it should not beep and turn off the light until the end of the brew cycle and not at the start. I am exchanging this unit for a replacement, and I hope that I can change my review once the new unit arrives.The second unit arrived promptly and is making excellent coffee on both the Normal and Strong settings. It's easy to use and easy to clean."
cmmd,1.0,"September 2, 2016","Not even 1 year after using this coffeemaker- it no longer works. While it lasted- it was a pretty decent machine. However, the water no longer moves from the tank. The lights turn on, the clock works, but there is no brewing. Apparently this is pretty common with this coffeemaker. The reviews I read at the time I decided to purchase indicated it was an excellent product. Save your money and get something else."
J&G,3.0,"May 25, 2020",I bought this same coffee maker from Amazon exactly 1 year ago and it was only $46.32 and now it's $74.99 on Amazon. Talk about price gouging. My second one developed a crack in the base that hold the coffee filter so water leaks down in the inside of the unit and on to the hot plate and eventually the kitchen counter.
C. J. Daniel,1.0,"July 22, 2017","Died after a year and a half. Until then we liked it, but a year and a half is kind of a BS timeline for a simple appliance. Amazon wouldn't refund it either, said I had to work with the manufacturer to get their refund. Am I supposed to wait to replace a coffee machine until I can get through a manufacturer's refund process? We work."
M. M. Lussier,2.0,"June 5, 2015","Great coffee pot. Coffee nice and hot.  Love it. Great seller. Super quick delivery. ThanksUPDATE - 7/20/2015.  So after a little less than 3 short months of 5 star use with this machine, I am sad to have to write this update.  About 2 weeks ago my machine was making these boiling sounds even after brewing.  Machine got very hot.  Cleaned machine according to directions.  Machine worked 4 more times before actually stopping working.  Very disappointed!!!"
hawkmom,1.0,"September 4, 2015","had to replace a cuisnart (which I loved) but didn't have a big budget.  Love this coffee pot.  works great and was a great price.  would highly recommend.  use it on a daily basisREVISED REVIEW---it quit working.  wake up on a chilly morning and no coffee. turn it on and off, nothing.  unplugged it and plugged it back in, nothing.  Used it daily for 2 months.  Won't buy another Mr Coffee."
J. T. Gotsick,4.0,"May 31, 2014","No complaints at all, it makes quite good coffee and is relatively easy to clean.  My only complaint would be with the 'strong' setting, which doesn't seem to work.  I've looked at the manual a bit and not found an obvious reason for this, but I kind of hate having a feature I can't access.  Still, the coffee made on the normal setting is reasonably strong, and I don't think most people would ever use the 'strong' setting anyway.  A good value in a drip coffeemaker."
Keith,5.0,"January 9, 2014","Several reviews commented about a smell to the machine, but we never experienced that.  We loved this machine as soon as we got it, and haven't looked back.  We're big fans of the thermal coffee pot because the burner on the machine doesn't stay on which is safer (the pot keeps the coffee warm, not the burner) so we ordered the matching thermal pot and actually have only used the glass pot that comes with the machine a handful of times.  This coffee maker looks great, works great, and has met our every need!"
O'cono,1.0,"September 28, 2015","We bought this to replace an older model Mr. Coffee programmable coffee maker - we had used that daily for at least 5 years.  We've had this model for less than 6 months and the programmable function no longer works.  We bought it so we could make it and set it in the evening.  It makes coffee, but that's it - wouldn't buy this model again.Update:  This Mr. Coffee died December 23, so I will never buy this model again - definitely not worth the money"
D. Wright,5.0,"November 22, 2011","My old faithful coffeemaker stopped working. In my house we drink coffee everyday all day. When the coffeemaker broke down on a Friday and before we had our coffee, we needed one right away. It was an emergency. I was so surprise when this coffeemaker arrived so early in the morning the next day, on a Saturday. The coffeemaker was beautiful it matched my kitchen. The coffee came out perfect every time. I didn't think I would find a coffee maker that was better than the one I already had,but I did and at a price I could afford. I love this coffeemaker. I do recommend it."
CkandLH,5.0,"August 31, 2015","I was nervous about buying this because the reviews seemed so 50/50 people either loved or hated this...and some of the reviews were from 5 years ago! Well, we've had great luck with this coffee maker and couldn't be happier with it...we use the permanent filter from Mr Coffee, and have had no spills/overflow or plastic smell/taste. It looks good on our counter too. We are happy with our delicious coffee at a very reasonable price. I would def recommend!"
Swaffar,5.0,"September 3, 2016","Nice coffee pot.  Description was accurate. Easily programmed.  Convenient open top to add coffee and water.  Closing the lid automatically positions the pump arm perfectly over the coffee basket for brewing.  The filter is an added bonus.  I use filtered water most of the time, but for those mornings when I don't have time to filter the water first, the basket filter is a great option."
Mohammed,5.0,"July 17, 2019",This machine has been making coffee for me and my family for 4 years now. Not once did it break nor did it show any issues. I’d definitely buy it again when I move to Richmond.
Michele Cavanaugh,5.0,"June 23, 2016",Bought this coffee maker for my inlaws as a gift.  they absolutely love it!  We took it over last evening to set it up and show them how to use it and it is very user friendly as we were afraid it might be a little too techy for them.  She called me this am so excited that when she woke up her coffee was already made.  I also bought this for my husband as he loved the one we bought for his parents
torres,3.0,"February 24, 2015","Purchased this as a gift for parents who leave for work at 5am and wanted to save them time on making coffee because they can program it to have it ready. The machine works great only thing is that it would not turn on for when we programmed it. Have tried many ways and times but it just wont turn on. Avoided the hassle or returning it since it does work and brews quickly, but I wish it would turn on for the programmed time."
TeA,2.0,"November 13, 2016","I purchase the unit on Dec 9th 2015, and it died this morning.  One should expect a product last more than a year.  The warranty process is complicated and shipping cost is more costly than buying a new unit.  Nice strategy!  I will not be buying another Mr. Coffee product now or in the future.  This is not the first product I've had with Mr. Coffee.  Seldom do we get a long length of service.  Everything is made of plastic these days."
Rob_N_SC,3.0,"February 6, 2016","Very easy to set up and use. I really like the strong brew option. I wish the clock was lit up, but it's not a big deal. However, my first maker did not make hot coffee, only lukewarm.  Kind of a pain to make coffee only to have to nuke it for a minute to make it hot. Just ordered a new replacement. I'll see how that goes..."
Loyah,5.0,"December 24, 2013","I like my coffee strong and had a Cuisinart with the cone shaped filters for many years.  It worked great for up to four cups.  However, whenever we had guests and I needed to brew eight or more cups, the coffee was awfully weak no matter how much coffee grind I would put into the filter.  For years, I would brew four cups and then four more with a new filter and fresh coffee grind to get reasonably strong coffee.  Then I decided to try the Mr. Coffee model based on excellent reviews at Consumer Reports. At less than $40, you cannot go wrong.  To my surprise, the Mr. Coffee machine with the cup shaped filters makes a terrific full pot of strong coffee, enough for 10 to 12 cups.  This machine is worlds better than the Cuisinart if brewing large amounts of coffee is what you regularly do.  And if you are only brewing one or two cups, the Mr. Coffee is just as excellent as the Cuisinart as well.  Highly recommended!"
lesliepm,3.0,"April 22, 2016","Look at the picture attached with this review - notice anything ƃuoɹʍ? :) Yeah, they sent us a machine with the logo ǝpᴉsdn uʍop! What the heck, Mr. Coffee. If I was a nocturnal bat, do you think I would need this coffee maker?When I received the coffee maker, it was upside down in the box but I figured that is no big deal. I read the whole manual, cleaned it out as instructed, put the pieces together, THEN I noticed that the logo was upside down. Despite it looking a little ridiculous, I figured an upside down logo never hurt anyone so I'd keep it.Before this machine, we used a single-serve coffee maker and a French Press. It has been a while since using a machine with a carafe, but so far it seems to do its job. We purchased the reusable coffee filter and some more water filters. I did not realize that when I bought the machine originally, but you will need to replace the water filter every month. It's not costly... it is about $5 for 6 filters on amazon.The beep on the machine caught me off guard at first... it beeps about four times and sounds kind of like a smoke detector. It will beep when it's done, and then beep again when it turns off automatically.Overall, for 35 bucks, I'd say it's worth it."
Reliable Robert,5.0,"June 10, 2013","I researched this purchase because this is an item that we use most everyday. I especially like that you can use either the glass  or thermal carafe. The coffee is hot when made and in the glass carafe stays hot. I am very pleased and doubt that more expensive makers produce coffee that is any better. The only reason to buy a more expensive coffee maker is to find one that looks more expensive on the counter - it will not function any better. As with all coffee makers, don't forget to clean it out with vinegar or the Mr. Coffee cleaner once a month. A leading Consumers Report service rated this particular Mr. Coffee model very high and we agree."
Donegal Shore,1.0,"August 1, 2018",I had the previous mr coffee from amazon. It was good. This new one does not have the thermal feature as advertised but the real issue is a horrible plastic smell that won’t go away after multiple cycles. You can even smell it in the coffee itself.
Mary F. Sutton,2.0,"March 28, 2016",When I opened the box I was stunned how pretty my new coffeemaker was. After a week it started leaking.  I thought I was doing something wrong.  After a while it started pouring. I had already had it to long so I ordered another one.  When I made coffee the first cup was good but when I went for the next cup the coffee was burned. I have to make one cup at a time. I have used Mr. Coffee products for 40+ years and have always been pleased. I'm afraid I found the bad apple in this one.
T. KOWALCZYK,4.0,"August 4, 2015","+ Brews good coffee+ Attractive design+ Easy to use+ Water nozzle automatically swings over the filter when you close the lid+ Glass pot is easy to clean, durable pot lid+ Pot feels comfortable in hand- Wish the digital readout was illuminated, can't read it in the dark- The brushed finish has gotten water spots or something that won't wipe away"
Callasjoy,3.0,"December 20, 2011","I thought this was well a reviewed and a good option, However, the instructions are difficult to understand, so far my ""auto on"" feature didn't work and the coffee had to be manually started...also the lack of back lit clock, along with the size of it and the way it is positioned on the unit, makes it almost impossible to see. Certainly would not be a ""kitchen clock"" as it was purported to be. I also cannot see a way to turn it on or off...Am I missing something? All i see is the ""Brew now/Brew later option...Is that the power button? Perhaps this is less review and more looking for assistance! Any one with experience, i welcome input!"
Chris H,5.0,"September 2, 2014","Having used a Keurig with reusable cups for the last two years, I wanted something that would have coffee ready for me in large doses.  Stayed with friends over a weekend and got to use this particular model at their house.  While it doesn't have a lot of features, the capacity if great, easy to program and does a good job at making coffee.  Highly recommend trying this out before spending a lot more money on the other popular models."
no geek,1.0,"October 13, 2013","One of the joys of doing drip coffee in the morning is having that fresh coffee smell permeate your kitchen .. One of the realities of owning this ""highly recommended"" Mr Coffee maker is the smell of plastic .. and the followon taste of plastic as you sip your much needed first cup in the morning ..Add Mr Coffee to former reliable brands that have been re-engineered to be cost reduced into less than mediocrity ..Potential purchasers .. read the user reviews .. not Consumer Reports ... you don;t have to be a coffee snob to hate that plastic smell and taste"
Debra Todd,5.0,"June 26, 2014","Can't really go wrong with a Mr. Coffee brand maker. This one is nice looking and has a clock, it gives a little beep beep beep when it's done brewing, and even beeps at you to let you know it's turning off. It has two settings for brewing. Regular and Strong. Also has a setting for the type of carafe, Glass or Thermal.  I really like this one. It's easy to pour the water into as well. For the price (At my time of purchase) TOTAL $37.62 with tax, it's very well worth it."
Kindle Customer,4.0,"January 12, 2014","There are always several diverse views on almost everything, including this coffee pot.  My experience:  works great, easy to use.,  coffee stays hot, no smell, no plastic taste, just a drop or 2 when you use the pot before it's through brewing, no big deal.  Would give this a 5 star if the time was more visible---it is black, doesn't really show up unless you are right in front of it--blue would have been a much better choice and a lot easier to make out.  Would definitely buy again."
Penny Pincher,1.0,"May 31, 2016","This coffee pot really was a flop. I purchased two and both of them had the same problem- the coffee basket backed up in both of them once the water came in causing the grounds to overflow into the water storage and into the pot, as well as water to overflow out of the coffee maker. BIG MESS! Both times the seller refunded and returned the pot, but I won't make the same mistake again."
M,1.0,"October 16, 2014","Sent it back within a few hours of arrival. I knew that it would have that raw plastic smell, but I had no idea how badly. I ran about 5 full pots of water through it and the water that came out still smelled incredibly toxic. I, like many of you, was hopeful based on many good reviews of this product all over the web, but there's no way I will put what came out of this machine into my body, both for the sake of my health and for the sake of good coffee."
Rebecca Oldenburg,5.0,"December 30, 2016",This was a replacement for one nearly identical that I have been using for 5 years or so.  Its burner was no longer keeping coffee hot.  The only thing I can say that is different on this model is that the beeper telling you the coffee is done or the maker is turning off is kind of pathetic.
Meegan,4.0,"January 4, 2015",Great coffeemaker for the money.... need to be very careful that you have itset just right... The top of the coffee pot must line up exactly with the interior filteror the coffee cannot flow into the pot and it will overflow.  once you know enough tomake sure that is done the coffeemaker really works well.  A lot of nice features you donot except to see on a coffeemaker at this price point.
Rofox,4.0,"October 1, 2012","This is a good product, as one would expect from Mr. Coffee. We had the thermos kind for ten years and miss that somewhat. One of the plastic nibs that makes the lid secure was broken off in packaging, but that doesn't interfere with the quality. We have had it ""overflow"" a couple of times when placed on the ""strong"" setting, and maybe that was due to operator error.  It is easy to use and program. The lid is our only issue, but we are already used to it. Consumer Report convinced us to buy this and we are happy."
Leah,5.0,"May 16, 2021",Good product. Makes coffee. Never had any issues.
M. Christie,3.0,"May 31, 2016","The coffee maker smells like plastic for the first few pot-fulls, and was weak to taste.So I then did the strong brew selection and that did fine. Backed off using the 'strong' to regular and just added a bit more coffee. Now the problem is that the coffee does not drain fast enough from the basket so now I am getting grounds in the carafe and in the coffee cup. Is a work in progress.........."
Jim,4.0,"October 29, 2013","I bought this to replace a more expensive Cuisinart coffee maker (that looks similar to this). That Cuisinart was the second one we had of the same model -- each of lasted a couple of years. This Mr. Coffee is good. The construction and fit-and-finish isn't as nice as the Cuisinart, but it brews a good, hot pot of coffee. Note it's a flat-bottom filter -- if that means anything to you. We'll see how long it lasts, but it it lasts a year, it'll be a better value than the Cuisinart."
Mimosa,1.0,"December 2, 2015","Good looks but works awful. The hot plate gets too hot that it gets burned. A strange burning smell comes out and we have to take the glass pot out of it, so our coffee gets cold in minutes. Not good. Hot plate has an ugly white stain that looks burned. Just terrible. I don't recommend buying this cheap product, even though it may look of good quality it is not. Spend more, and get a product that works right. Our 34 bucks went to waste."
Patricia A. Burke,1.0,"March 8, 2016",I bought this to replace an older model and I should have listened to the newer reviews and not bought it. The second thing I should have done was send it back within the thirty day window. The strong brew strength button turns off within 30 seconds and then it takes 15 minutes to brew and the coffee taste is not worth the wait. I have cleaned it and it makes no difference. So now the search is on again for a new coffee maker.
Amazon Customer,3.0,"October 15, 2016","I like it makes great coffee ,but I am already in my second replacement in the first year of ownership ! As soon as it doesn't work it is replaced but my second replacement is a totally different coffee maker and I haven't even tried it yet still using a spare I already had ! Good item for extended warranty after first year I will bet it needs replacing again ! Doesn't say much for the quality but the coffee is great !"
J. A. Cosentino Jr.,4.0,"September 2, 2012","I needed to replace my Krups coffeemaker of many years and Consumer Reports recommended this model.  Compared to the old Krups, this one is indeed dark and bulky.  I doubt I'll use the timer.  It makes more coffee than the old Krups and I'm still fiddling around with the amount of beans to get it just right.  Pouring is more precise, fewer spills.  I wonder about durability, though, because after a few cycles in the dishwasher the printing is coming off the carafe.  Not a big deal for me because I brew only full pots, but do keep that in mind if you don't."
Lou Montgomery,1.0,"February 18, 2015","I bought this six months ago and am buying a replacement brand today.  It makes weak coffee because the hot water does not penetrate all of the ground coffee in the basket.  The hot water only leaks into one small portion of the coffee grounds. The grounds on the other side of the basket are almost dry. I've cleaned the unit and tried everything to get the water to disperse throughout the grounds but no luck.  Life is too short to drink weak coffee.  I'm getting another brand, one that sends the hot water into the basket with enough strength for the hot water to reach all of the coffee grounds."
Fred Jones,1.0,"December 13, 2015","Horrific chemical smell that won't go away.  I ran over 20 pots of vinegar and water through it, and still strong.  When I first opened the box, you could smell the weird plastic chemical smell IN THE OTHER ROOM, it was so potent."
Rebecca E,5.0,"May 13, 2014",This coffeemaker is so sleek and expensive looking.  I like the shape of the coffee pot and the program features.  I've tried other brands of coffeemakers but always come back to Mr. Coffee.  This coffeemaker has some extras I didn't expect.  It beeps when it is finished brewing and beeps again when the heating plate is turning off after 2 hours.  It also has a place in the back to put the cord in when it is not in use.  I really like that feature it is so much easier than trying to hide the cord. I highly recommend this coffeemaker!
Robert,4.0,"August 8, 2014","So far, so good, Only have it for about a month and it is working well. The coffee is good, hot and tastes well.Like the way the water sprays down onto the coffee grounds, allowing for a better taste.As the water in this area is not good and high in iron, I have a whole house water filtration system, which takes away anychlorine and other additives, which gives me a good coffee taste and it also keeps my and the house's pipes cleaner."
patbeone,5.0,"January 24, 2014","I've had a Hamilton Beach for several years and it made great coffee but the spout no longer worked (even after vigorous cleanings).  I would have purchased another HB product but did not like the choices.  After much research, I chose this Mr. Coffee thinking for $30 surely it would last a few months.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it makes great coffee quickly and is easily cleaned.  I would definitely recommend this particular coffee maker to others."
michaelj,3.0,"November 4, 2013","The coffeemaker seems to be of good quality.  Maybe my expectations were too high. One minor thing I don't like is the need to take the coffee holder completely out of the coffeemaker to load coffee into the holder.  With my cuisinart I could take the used filter out of the holder, replace it with an unused filter,  grind my coffee in the grinder and dump the coffee right back into the holder.  I (maybe it's me) have to take the coffee holder completely out of the Mr. Coffee before reloading with coffee.  It's minor but it is the thing I most notice.  Coffee quality is good price is good."
robert g.,1.0,"February 29, 2016","this is the second coffeemaker that i have had just up and stop working after less than 6 months. fool me once ,your fault, fool me twice my fault there will never be another mr. coffee maker in my house again. they use to last for years,but they are now junk plastic china made trash can fill."
T. Kent,5.0,"March 19, 2015","This coffee maker is awesome! I bought the thermal carafe to go with it. The coffee maker knows which carafe is emplaced and the functionality of the device is simple. I replaced a coffee maker that was about 8 years old and was on it last leg. I made the first pot of coffee two days ago. It was quick, simple, and made a great tasting pot of coffee. I would highly recommend this coffee maker. Just make sure you buy the thermal pot too."
Patricia,4.0,"May 31, 2016","This is a good coffee pot, but there is no temperature adjustment for warming plate. My old Mr coffee did so I might just be spoiled, but this gets the coffee SUPER hot. It gets so hot you can't drink it fresh out of the pot. Also not able to turn off the beeping noise. If hot coffee and the beeping don't bother you than its great."
Rebecca C.,5.0,"December 11, 2013","Great coffee maker.  I needed a new one for Thanksgiving company and this fit the bill.  I read reviews from a magazine and this was listed very high, so I didn't think I could go wrong.  It's easy to use, simple, no fancy bells and whistles.  You don't have to keep the instruction manual next to it to figure the thing out!Everyone at Thanksgiving LOVED the coffee and I know it wasn't me that made it taste so good....so...it must be this coffee maker!"
D. G. Lee,4.0,"November 7, 2012","I bought this coffee maker after reading the reviews for it on Amazon. It was not the highest-rated one by Consumer Reports, but owners of it actually liked it very much. One person, in particular, provided very thorough and thoughtful information that persuaded me to try it. The biggest concern I had was whether or not the coffee would be hot enough to suit me; most drip makers come up with very lukewarm coffee. This one operates very well in that regard, and I would buy another one."
Customer in Southern California,5.0,"July 31, 2014","I was in dire need of a new coffeepot when my old Gevalia pot died. I was pleased to find this coffeemaker on sale at Amazon. I perused the reviews and decided to try it. I love it. There was no plastic taste as mentioned in other reviews, but then I did rinse the interior first, washed the other parts, then ran one pot of hot water before brewing. The coffee stays hot and I discovered I prefer it brew strong. It's also easy to use and clean."
WK. Sevedge,4.0,"June 2, 2013","You will get a great cup of coffee after a little preparation.  We bought this Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT because we already owned the thermal pot.  After unpacking and starting it up, we flushed it out twice before making the first pot, the coffee had an aftertaste.  We used it for three days with the same result. We were about ready to return it, when I decided to flush it again with a 1/4-1/2 cup of white vinegar to 12 cups water (full decanter).  I then flushed it 4 more times.  Now it makes a great cup of coffee, and even after 3 hours using the glass decanter, the coffee doesn't taste burned.  Hope this helps."
V. McMurray,3.0,"December 27, 2012","it makes coffee fine but:  it' s too tall to fit under my cabinet when the water reservoir is open, filling the reservoir is not as easy as it could be, the coffee basket and filter are awkwardly placed and only fit in a specific direction and if you forget to swing the little water delivery arm back into place after putting the coffee and filter in, the coffee can' t be brewed.  my old coffee maker was MUCH easier to use.  funny, but for some reason I thought newer would be better!"
Mohak,5.0,"October 3, 2015","It works great and helps me start the morning off right. As a college student, that's a pretty difficult task, but nothing like a cup or two of coffee before getting to work on my papers. Lots of pretty cool settings and stuff too and it makes it relatively quickly. Nothing really negative to report, I've been using it everyday since purchase and it still works as good as day 1, so good enough."
ruby2277,5.0,"May 11, 2011","We purchased the Mr. Coffee 12-cup Coffeemaker for use in our real estate office.  I have to say it is a great value! We generally brew one pot a day. I really like this version.  I will buy another one for my home when I need one. First of all, it is a very good looking coffee maker.  It brews fairly quickly and makes a little beep to let you know when it's done. It keeps the brewed coffee at a good temperature without getting any burnt smell, and it makes a good cup of coffee! I selected based up a combination of the reviews and price and feel like a got a real bargain!"
Ovieda Estrada,4.0,"January 11, 2014",I bought this for a gift for a young man who just got a job after a long time without one and didn't have the extra $ for a good coffee pot.  This made a good impression as he thought I spent a lot more $ than I did.  Programmable features are perfect for him so he can set the coffee up the night before and be ready in the morning.  It looks sharp and he is very happy with it.  I cant give more details on the carafe or service since it's not at my house.
Superman,5.0,"February 24, 2015","So far so good.  Took a bit to read through the proper way to fire it up. But this got great reviews on Consumer Reports so I was confident it was worth the effort.  Plus my last Mr. Coffee, (different style), lasted a solid 10-years before it started needing replacing.Wow!  I've never tasted coffee from my own cup as good as with this coffeemaker!  I think the added water filter makes the difference."
Jesferkicks,4.0,"December 6, 2013","Brewer works great and looks good too.  Package arrived with in the allotted time.  This was a gift to my mother who is satisfied with it.  I couldn't go 5 stars simply because the instruction booklet is a little weak and it confused my mother. This cost me half an hour to read and explain.  Otherwise, good deal especially now that she can set up her morning coffee the night before and the brewer's programmable start kicks it on at zero five o'clock each morning.  It automatically turns itself off two hours later."
Boxes Everyday,3.0,"February 9, 2017",We bought this in August. It's now February and as of today it will not brew. Nothing seems to be wrong with it and it hasn't given us any issues up to today when it just will not brew the coffee. The light comes on but nothing happens. Disappointed because we haven't had that long and I really liked it up until now.
JACK LEE,1.0,"November 25, 2015","Great unit! Looks good, easy to clean, and makes great coffee. October 2015.11/27/2017Mr. Coffee will not make coffee. It is getting electricity, but will not cycle through and make coffee.I have unplugged it hoping it would reset, but it did not. I have a ""whole house"" surge protector, so I knowthat is not the problem.A little over two years old.I guess I will look for another brand."
MltMama,1.0,"May 20, 2018",Stopped working after 3 years. Coffee never tasted right either. I’ve gone back to my no frills Black Decker and am enjoying coffee again. I didn’t know the pot was why I wasn’t enjoying a good cup. I was switching coffee brands!
Tuck Man From Texas,1.0,"July 30, 2016","Always have had good luck with the Mr. Coffee brand. I guess it was my time for a bad one. Just would not circulate the water while it heated. Not worth the time and effort to return to the warranty center, Bought it March 28,2016, past Amazon's return date. while it worked, it worked good but would have been nice to work longer than 4 months."
Shelly,4.0,"June 7, 2014","I was pleasantly surprised to like the cup of coffee I get from this coffee maker.  My husband and I aren't very picky about our overall coffee experience, but we do want it to taste good and this does.A much better deal than the $90.00 Cuisinart we've purchased in the past.  Coffee wasn't that great and the machines break or malfunction after 2 years.This machine cost $30.00; delivers a good tasting coffee (equivalent or better than our Cuisinart) and is a better value than our old machine."
kimberly,1.0,"February 11, 2016","Had to return this as a defective item.  The carafe doesn't sit in the machine correctly, and coffee spills all over the counter. A pretty bad defect. I've returned it for a replacement, and hope it will be better this time.  Strange for a Mr. Coffee; they're usually pretty reliable."
Muppy,1.0,"August 13, 2015","I had this coffee maker 44 days & it almost started a fire. It is supposed to shut off @ 2 hrs. It did, BUT..the heating plate never did and subsequently burned the glass carafe. The only way it completely shuts off now is to unplug it. The ""return"" period of time was past so I'm stuck with a defective product.  I am NOT a happy camper !!!!!!!"
BeerMC00,4.0,"February 18, 2014","This coffee maker was a great buy. It makes a great cup of coffee, good flavor, keeps it at the proper hot temperature and has just enough features to be useful but not overcomplicated. It has the capability to use an insulated carafe instead of the glass one it comes with and I find that coffee that sits on a burner to stay warm tastes burned after a while. I wish it came with both the glass carafe and the insulated one. The coffee stays fresher tasting longer if it isn't sitting on a direct heat burner."
Keith Hoffmann,5.0,"August 12, 2016",Absolutely love it. I had the Ninja coffee bar I got for Christmas and after 4 months it quit. Was nice to have a good cup of coffee again. I usually get a lot of coffee on the burner as the no drip never works right but this machine stays clean and it is easy to clean also. I set it for 3:30 am and it is ready for me at 4:00 am when I get up to go to work.
Will C.,4.0,"May 18, 2013","My $100 coffeemaker burned out after 18 months. I average one six-cup pot per day. Had problems with previous makers in similar price range. Based on Consumer Reports rating and Amazon reviews decided to try this less expensive model.I've only had it a few days, but am very satisfied. It brews coffee hot...actually hotter than my others. Everything works and it is attractive. It brews good coffee which is the main thing.Very satisfied."
Marc Penrd,5.0,"October 30, 2015","I have used this coffeemaker nearly every day for eleven months.  The coffee (Kirkland Columbian from Costco) is consistantly good.  The clock and timer are easy to set.  I change the filter every two months and use a wire basket instead of paper filters.  The burner began to show some discoloration after a few months of use, but that is only cosmetic.  I would recommend this coffee maker to people who are looking for an easy to use and program affordable coffee maker."
prodreview,2.0,"November 25, 2020","Only lasted 4 years, a lot of use, but expected it to last longer."
Van Taylor,2.0,"August 4, 2013","My wife and I have been using coffeemakers made by Mr. Coffee for more than 25 years, and they have been good and dependable. When I read reviews posted on Amazon.com for this coffeemaker, I was impressed, and we ordered it. It looked nice; it had features we liked; and we were sure it would be as good as our last Mr. Coffee, which had lasted more than 5 years.This Mr. Coffee was a huge disappointment. It worked fine for about a week, and, then, it just quit. I was surprised, but it was ""no big deal,"" and I contacted Amazon.com, notified them that it had failed and requested a replacement. I was issued a bar code return authorization, which I decided to print at my office; but UPS came to our house so quickly, and my wife, who had no idea what was going on and didn't know that the return authorization had to be packed with the coffeemaker, simply gave it to the UPS man. Adios.When I got home with the return authorization, and my wife told me what had happened, I was pretty disappointed. I tried to figure out what to do. With the pick-up having been arranged by Amazon, and knowing ""goof-ups"" like this must've happened before, I thought Amazon might be able to work this return backwards and figure out that I had returned this coffeemaker. That didn't happen. While I could have taken up our mistake with my credit card company, I just sucked it up, knowing thaT I'd be charged for this coffeemaker, twice.When the second coffeemaker arrived, we used it for about a week and decided we really didn't like it. Because my wife had won a coffeemaker made by Cuisinart from the grocery store, we began using it instead and put this Mr. Coffee coffeemaker in the mother-in-law suite.I would not recommend this coffeemaker."
shoppin'mama,1.0,"June 5, 2016","The coffee grounds were always getting into the coffee while brewing (basket too small). A few times, I left it to brew and ended up with coffee all over the counter when I came back into the kitchen. It finally stopped working completely after 6 months of use at our VACATION HOME (it was not up against daily use!!!). Absolutely terrible, do not waste your money!"
Clifford B. Farris,5.0,"March 15, 2013","We have used this coffee maker for a couple of days so far and are highly pleased.  Compared to our previous Mr. Coffee model that started leaking the past couple of weeks, this is better.  Notably, the coffee is smoother (I don't know how they did that but it is the case) and is hotter.  It comes out about 174 F.Speed of brewing is about the same.  It takes 7 minutes to make 12 normal strength cups, and 11 minutes on strong.  They both were 900w."
Cheri Davis,5.0,"August 24, 2011","We recently bought this coffeemaker after having our expensive Capresso die after less than 2 years. We seem to have issues with expensive coffeemakers (die every time within a 2 yr frame). We decided to buy the Mr Coffee after reading the reviews. We love it so much that we bought a second for parties and a back up! It makes great hot coffee, no problems with leaking and it is our new favorite kitchen appliance. Highly recommend it!"
Denjgg,5.0,"December 23, 2013","The Mr. Coffee 12 Cup programmable Coffeemaker is easy to use, easy to clean, and makes a great cup of coffee. I use mine with the permanent filter and have had no problems with the coffee being to strong or grinds getting into the coffee. I find that it works best using the water measurement gauge on the side of the coffeemaker instead of using the pot to gauge how much water you are adding. I also use a measuring spoon to put the right amount of coffee in the filter. makes a perfect cup of coffee every time."
B. Carlson,3.0,"August 16, 2017",I would have given this more stars had it lasted longer than a year and a half.  It just stopped working yesterday mid-brew.  It was a good coffee maker up until that point.  Is it typical for a Mr Coffee to just last that long?  It's the first one I've purchased in years.
J. M. Hoffmann,4.0,"March 7, 2015","This is okay. I don't like the way the pre-set works--hit the preset, then the on button twice. If I don't hit the on button the second time quick enough or if it doesn't catch it starts to brew. Also, the glass carafe immediately stained. I have never had a coffee pot that did this. I'm not going to wash it out daily with vinegar or chemicals, because that would taint the taste of the coffee. A little disappointed given the high reviews."
deborah burrows,5.0,"January 19, 2014","i bought this coffee maker for my husband as a christmas present, because he keeps buying cheap coffee makers makes that crap out after a month or two.  the instructions are easy to follow, and in my opinion, this coffee maker is well worth the money.  p.s. i did my research, and consumer reports gave this coffee maker the second highest rating ( the first highest rating was a bling-bling jeweled encrusted coffee maker for some outragous price....some hundreds of dollars worth!)  the mr. coffe bvmc-sjx33gt is a very good buy."
Cheryl Culver,5.0,"August 6, 2016","I like this coffee maker, I like that it has a extra filter for purifying the water better than any other coffee maker we have had and we have tried a lot of brands before this one. The water goes in the top easily too, the only thing that I would prefer is a larger display that is easier to read across the room like other brands."
Papa Gibbles,5.0,"July 31, 2012","Based on recommendations from a national consumer magazine, I bought this coffee maker to replace the Bunn I have had for a number of years. Although there were some negative comments about setting up the timer, etc., I found it pretty easy to set up. I did go on-line and view a video on You Tube for setting it up and it really helped. The coffee has always tasted good right from the first pot.So far, it has worked flawlessly. My Bunn did not have an automatic timer, so I love getting up and having the coffee already made. I have the glass coffee pot and it stays hot for up to 2 hours. The coffee never lasts that long in the house.For the price at Amazon, you can't beat this coffee maker. I recommend it."
butterflywish,5.0,"August 16, 2014","You can have your $.50 a cup Keurig or however much you can get down to by cleaning that tiny filter and then filling the tiny thimble thingy. Forget about it! This machine is cheap! yeah I said cheap but not cheap like dollar store dish soap cheap.  It's cheap for what it does.  It makes great HOT coffee and you don't have to read pages of a manual to figure out how to use it.  Don't buy in to all the marketing when it comes to brewing a perfect cup (and I like good coffee and can tell the difference between a good roast and the cheap-o crap). Is it Starbucks? Well no but if you use good tasting water and use the carbon filter provided along with a well roasted quality bean like a Starbucks brand or similar, it is close and I mean close as in you take a sip, turn toward your wife and watch as you both turn a slow grin knowing the day is going to be great because son of a bugger that's a dang good cup of joe!"
Eric F.,5.0,"August 9, 2016",The maker arrived ON time and in great condition! After washing it I began using it and have had no issues even though it has been used for months!!!!! The directions are easy to understand and the control panel is not hard to comprehend. One touch brewing after you add the ingredients.Solid purchase.
Jessica,4.0,"January 26, 2015","I received my new Mr. Coffee maker today. There was a slight smell of plastic, as told by other reviews on this product, but it wasnt as nearly as overwhelming as most people say. I ran a vinegar solution through to clean it first, followed by two cycles of water. The first pot of coffee I made was perfect. The chrome look makes my kitchen look nice! For $25 you really cant find a better coffee pot."
Laura V.,2.0,"March 16, 2015","This machine makes ok coffee.  But it BEEPS when the brew cycle is done.  Which was not in the product description, and is a major problem with our kitchen/bedroom layout when someone is brewing coffee at 6 am while other people are sleeping -- oh wait, they can't sleep anymore because the beeper is as loud as a smoke detector going off.  I am returning this machine because i don't want to have to brew my morning coffee in the basement where no one can hear the bloody beeper going off."
Mr-T,2.0,"October 7, 2016",This coffee maker is ok however 10 months later all coating on the heating plate is just about burned off and rusted .......this coffee maker should have lasted much longer......My other Mr. Coffee products weren't as fancy but sure did last longer....wish I could return for a new one.....PS..we are very gentle on this product.
K Child,2.0,"July 6, 2015","I've had this coffee maker for about 2 years now, and after having it for about a month, it started to smell very musty. No matter how hard I tried to clean it, the musty smell remained. The machine worked fine for almost as long as I've had it, but recently it started leaking and dripping very badly during coffee making process. I had to put a towel under it just to catch all the water that was dripping off the top. Towel gets soaked every time coffee is made. Not pleased with this purchase."
Nate,4.0,"April 1, 2015","Pros:- Inexpensive- Consistent and durableCons:- Coffee pot tends to drip a little when pouring to cup.- Overacidifies coffee due to high heat being concentrated on one area of grounds. More a problem with style of machine than this specific machine.Overall: This purchase was made for everyday use in a small business facility. It has been the workhorse it was intended to be and has had no issues beyond the minor complaints in the Cons list. If you are looking for a simple coffee maker, this is a decent choice. If you are looking to make world-class coffee, this isn't a machine (or even style of machine) you would run it through."
C. Ottaviano,4.0,"October 20, 2014","It's a standard coffee maker. Does everything it says it should.  Nothing particular about it that I don't like but nothing that stands out to mention as wonderful.  It makes coffee pretty well.  The top flap is annoying because it hits the bottom of my cabinet - there's not enough clearance and my kitchen is a standard height with counters and cabinets, etc.  The price is reasonable for what you get."
Kidney Doc,5.0,"June 7, 2012","This makes the best coffee ever!  We use the strong setting and the coffee is delicious.  But the carafe always seems to drip from the tip when pouring so you need to pour over the sink.  And the inside of the lid and the area around the coffee well get so wet that they do not try overnight, even if you leave lid open to the air.  We wipe these areas off with a paper towel after using.  However, these are a small price to pay for great coffee!"
beach granny,5.0,"January 2, 2014","We have owned higher end coffeemakers in the past, but this Mr Coffee 12 cup programmable is fantastic for this price point.  We were looking for a 12 cup as we are big coffee drinkers.  Easy easy easy to operate.  No leakage and it is compact and fits so easily on your countertop.  We have only owned it for a month so really can't comment on its long lasting reliability.  Has auto shut off after 2 hours.  We are very pleased with our purchase!"
"Norm Kostuck, Jr.",2.0,"April 25, 2012","Despite the good reviews, I received a lemmon.  Item was shipped to me on January 14, 2012 and within 2 months, water (condensation) was somehow getting into the digital clock/timer components and even when we first got the machine, we'd consistently put in 10 cups of water, but every brewing process produced significantly different amounts of coffee (either shorting us by 1-2 mugs of coffee---it was different every day).  Yesterday (April 24, 2012---a little over 3-months old), I heard a crackling sound in the kitchen, investigated, and discovered my coffee pot was making the sounds--shorting out (smell of burning electrical components).  I unplugged the machine and now am stuck paying shipping to send the coffee maker out of state to a service center for repairs (or replacement); and of course that means we won't have coffee for however long that takes.  Like I said, I'm sure most units are fine; I was just stuck with a lemmon.  Also, maybe this lemmon of a coffee maker explains the poor taste of the coffee (and we even grind our own beans) as compared to a previous machine we had made by Cuisinart; I think next time, I'll just pay more money to get a quality machine that produces delicious coffee."
Trisha,5.0,"September 16, 2015","I absolutely love this coffee machine, and loved the price. It looks great, it looks like a fancy coffee machine. It's programmable so you can tell it what time to make your coffee in the morning (if you remember to load it up at night - I never do!), and one very interesting thing is that it has a setting for ""strong"" coffee, which I very much appreciate. Great item."
Anna,1.0,"May 8, 2016","Started out great.  Was happy with it for awhile.  Then recently, the water temp started getting colder and colder and it was taking more and more coffee to get any kind of flavor.  Now the plate that keeps the coffee warm is dead, after only a little over a year.  Extremely disappointing."
Pumpkin1944,5.0,"July 27, 2014","Once I saw this coffee maker model received a great rating in the Consumer Report Magazine, this was on my shopping list as my husband is an avid coffee drinker. I think we've tried all brands and models but this one has turned out to be our favorite. First, when you pour the coffee into your cup, you don't end up with drips all over the place. The coffee is good and hot which we enjoy and the delay timer and strength features are good too."
Bennett Graham,5.0,"September 20, 2013","The unit functions very smoothly.  Hard to describe exactly what I like because I like everything about it.  Good user design.  Easy to fill tank, carafe is balanced, doesn't dribble and slides into chamber easily.  I use the gold tone mesh filter with water filter top and love that too.  Coffee tastes great.  When unpacking, carafe dropped out of unit and onto vinyl kitchen floor from height of 2 feet.  Didn't break.  Seemed packed oddly so take care unboxing."
Z,1.0,"July 17, 2016",stopped working after 9 months.  I was hesitant about buying a cheap coffee maker with so many functions.  Appears that one the circuits that starts the coffee making procedure stopped working.  All of the buttons and LED displays still work as if everything is fine--never used any of them but the brew now button.  Wouldn't buy again.
kjw,2.0,"October 19, 2015","I didn't expect much from this coffee maker based solely on the price.  But in less than a year, this turns itself off after only a few minutes of brewing resulting in lots of water remaining in the holding tank and very little brewed coffee.  This does not work for someone like me...I need my morning coffee fix.  This is not worth the money, and I am sorely disappointed with this product."
iamscifly,5.0,"July 28, 2013","This coffee maker does it it says it will do. It makes coffee. It makes it well. It takes water, it heats it up, it strains it through coffee grounds. that't what it promised it would do, and that's what it does. I would have paid more for a cocainemaker. I am too tired at 4 am for anything less. This still gets 5 stars, because I can put 8 cups worth of coffee grounds in 4 cups worth of water. whatever gets you up in the morning."
Rachel,5.0,"July 1, 2016","This coffee pot has saved me. Our Keurig quit about 3 months ago, so I ordered this coffee pot, thinking that I couldn't go wrong with a trusted brand, I WAS RIGHT. It makes the perfect cup of coffee, has an automatic shut off and brews rather quickly. I like that there is a ""need coffee now"" option. So if you think the brew time is taking too long, you can take the decanter out (while it is finishing the brew cycle) and pour yourself a cup before it's done!"
W D F,5.0,"December 29, 2012","Seems like it's pretty hard now days to get something and have it perform as advertised. But as I drink my morning coffee and write this, I can honestly say Mr. Coffed has done it. The only thing I could complain about is that the paper filter will bend over once in a great while and some grounds will get in the coffee...but... I could say that about my old maker.  Anyway, I ordered the reusable type filter (fm Amazon) and will use it."
Lh,3.0,"June 23, 2015","This is the first change from 2 comparable Black & Decker programmable models that cost half as much and lasted 10 years each. I decided to switch because B&D changed their carafe shape so that it spills every time you pour from it. This carafe, though narrow at the top, has no problems pouring. I like the B&D basket and water filter arrangement more. I have to fiddle with this one to get it to fit just right such that I can move the sprayer arm over the basket. B&D models don't have a sprayer you have to move twice a day. Also, much to my surprise, this does NOT have a grab-a-cup feature! I made quite a mess when I pulled the carafe out to pour a cup while it was brewing this morning. For the price, it should have that feature. The bvrew strength feature is not very useful either. If you use the permanent gold filter, it has a sold plastic bottom (also different from B&D). So the coffee grounds spend more time with the water in this model, whichever brew strength you use. Finally the clock is so dark and poorly located on this unit as to be useless. I used to use the B&D coffeemaker as a kitchen clock because it was a bright red LED on the bottom angled to be very readable. So I like the spill-free carafe but everything else is better on Black and Decker for half the price."
gotmoretoys,3.0,"September 5, 2015","Makes decent hot coffee.Sometimes there is a hot plastic smell that does not affect the brew.Easy to fill and clean.After 1 year and 3 months the power switch became intermittent and finally stopped working.The LCD display would get foggy from condensation, mostly unreadable.The carafe is really a wonderful piece of glasswork."
Amazon Customer,4.0,"November 4, 2013","The coffee maker works well.  I did not detect any plastic taste, as others have mentioned.  Everything works as expected - clock settings, programming, etc.  One caution I would throw out to anyone contemplating a purchase is that the coffee maker, as it is shipped from Amazon, has no filters so it is impossible to use it until you make a separate purchase of paper filters or the gold plated basket.  Mr Coffee should have included a few filters so a consumer could use it right away."
Annemarie Frawley,5.0,"August 14, 2013","I had purchased a BUNN coffee machine a while back thinking it would be a great cup of coffee.  Wrong.  First, the brewing cycle took 12 to 15 minutes.  That is much too long to wait in the AM for my coffee before heading to work.  Secondly, the coffee was just not that great.  I tried adjusting the amount of coffee, but to no avail.  I finally read about the Mr. Coffee and decided to give it a try.Great purchase at about 1/4 the price of the BUNN.Love the coffee and the brew cycle is only a few minutes.  The machine also looks nice."
Ahywol,2.0,"December 1, 2016",The coffee maker stopped working after only 5 months. The customer service is also completely inadequate. The only option I had to have warranty service was to drop it off and later pick it up at one of their service centers... 2 hours driving each way.  No thanks and no thanks to any products by this company in the future. I would not recommend purchasing this.
Beemer,4.0,"May 5, 2017",Arrived quickly. Filter basket was broken but I was able to assemble it. This is our second one and just love this coffee maker. Be sure to clean periodically and it should last years. Only complaint is no back light for display but that's it. Great coffee maker for a great price!
Celeste,5.0,"December 14, 2014",I love this little coffee maker. It works great and does everything I need. My favorite feature is the delay timer. I can prep the coffee before I go to bed and have it ready when I wake up in the morning. The warmer stays on for 2 hours and the coffee will usually stay warm for another 30 minutes or so after that. It's easy to clean and prepping is a breeze. It even has a measurement on the side for the water so you know how much you've poured in without having to use a measuring cup.
RR,5.0,"November 5, 2011",Coffee tastes great.  The coffee maker does have an initial plastic taste but this quickly goes away.  I ran water through it the first time.  My first pot of coffee tasted like plastic but the second pot was delicious.  I think this may also be due to the filter being used for the first time.  Coffee is made very quickly.  All buttons are very easy to understand and I didn't even have to read the directions to figure it out.  Water reservoir is large and easy to fill with water.  A very slight drawback is that the coffee pot itself tends to spill coffee if you pour the coffee too quickly.  Just pour the coffee a little bit slower and coffee does not spill.  All in all a wonderful product!
JD,5.0,"March 19, 2014","I bought this unit with the DRD95 Steel Carafe and GTF2 permanent gold filter.  As other reviewers have noted, it does limit the pot to about eight cups of coffee.  However, they are really GOOD cups for the price.  I purchased an open-box item from Amazon  Warehouse Deals, including the extra 6-pack of charcoal filters and the carafe, all for around $50.  For $50, this machine makes a better cup of coffee than the Hamilton Beach unit it replaced at nearly twice the cost.  The unit works great, as advertised, and I have no complaints."
housewifenomore,1.0,"September 21, 2016","I lightly used this machine for 2 months for morning coffee, but received an espresso maker so I shelved it.  When demonstrating how to use it to my college bound son, it started smoking heavily along all of the seams.  Unfortunately, I didn't get the video of this because it was pouring smoke and I was worried about the fire and electrical hazard.So two months of light use and then fire hazard.The best coffee maker is still the old Mr. Coffee for $20."
Erin M. Kelley,4.0,"February 19, 2014","Since buying this coffee maker a few weeks ago, I love it. It is very pretty, easy to use, solid and stable. I love the fact that it can be for either a glass or thermal. I am thinking about getting the thermal carafe as well. Plus it gives you the option of regular or strong coffee. I love coffee, a single mother who is still going to school and working. So this coffee maker on my list of favorite things."
Reagan,5.0,"January 21, 2015",Wow!  Love this coffee maker! It's so easy to open and pour your water!  Makes a great pot of coffee!  I was tired of another top brand breaking plus the other was a lot more expensive!  This has been well worth the money by far!  The only thing I wish was that it was a 14-cup and gave you the option of programming it to automatically shut off after 4 hours instead of 2 hours.
MonstaWorld,2.0,"August 3, 2016","This coffee maker worked well for six month but then suddenly just stopped. The lights will turn on but it does not warm up or do anything. Also, the coffee is not the best I have had, it does not match the taste from a french press or even a Kurig instead. I would go back to my french  press or Keurig for better taste and lower footprint on the counter. AVOID this."
MommyToFour,5.0,"September 12, 2015",The features are what attracted me to this coffee pot. It is very high tech compared to our simple one push button coffee maker it replaced. It beeps when done brewing and after a few hrs beeps to let you know it is shutting off. I recently got my hubby a 4 cup coffee maker that wasn't big enough for him so we upgraded to this for him and its perfect.
Albert J. Reine,1.0,"March 17, 2016","My Mr. Coffee stopped working today May 17,  Only the unit for six months, the heating element went out.  Cheap plastic product, made in China, I would never buy another Mr. Coffee, my last Mr. Coffeet lasted 14 years..  Not worth the name it's printed on."
Professor Dave,5.0,"August 27, 2013","I like this very much. It makes great coffee and has buttons for normal or strong. I always choose strong, and I do not know what normal is like. Its height does not allow the top to open when under the counters, but it is light and can be easily moved out when adding water or adding or removing coffee or its grounds. A cute feature is that you don't have to swivel the steam arm before closing the lid. When you close the lid, it automatically moves to the correct position for making coffee."
Kim chan,3.0,"December 15, 2014","i'm replacing my old coffee maker (about 7 years old, due to glass breakage) and i was expecting something equivalent or better.  Yet, it doesn't match up to my expectation, not sure if i can put my finger on it.  perhaps was my change of beans or something else to alter the brewing effect i was searching.  Oh...one thing worthy of mentioning: the user manual isn't par....need to be update with much friendly instruction"
Judy Tullos,1.0,"June 12, 2016",Quit brewing after 3 months. Called protection plan and was informed that Mr Coffee guaranteed it for the first year and gave  me their number. Never could get a live person on the line and after going thru all of the stupid questions the auto voice informed me to clean it. By this time I was so frustrated it is now in garbage can city. Will not purchase another Mr Coffee or protection Plan.
Patrick,5.0,"April 29, 2014",I purchased two of these coffee makers. I have not used the timer on mine yet but that will definitely come in handy if I am planning on doing anything early in the morning and not have to fuss with making the coffee and have it waiting for me when I get up.This coffee maker was rated well in Consumers Report and that is why I purchased them. They are definitely holding up to their reviews.
Thomas Steinbeck,5.0,"January 13, 2013","Great machine. Makes a pot of coffee in less than 8 minutes. Easy to use. If my 81 year old mom can opperate it, an body can. I read a lot of reviews that said there was a plastic taste and smell, but I didn't get any of that. Makes a good cup of coffee. I don't see any need to pay for a more expensive machine. The only draw back I see with this unit is that the clock is not back lit. It makes it hard to see when you are setting the time or the timer."
Michael,5.0,"April 4, 2015",This coffee pot is perfect. It does its job and it does it well. I can honestly say that with the water filter this maker has my coffee tastes better. Looks great in the kitchen. I've had it for about a month and nothing but smooth operation. I bought a $50 coffee maker from Target (different brand) and was very dissatisfied. This is half the price and twice the product.
Jessica E. Black,3.0,"November 14, 2013","Tends to make weak coffee.  I think I prefer the pointy-type filters.  But if you choose strong beans, and the strong brew setting, it's passable.  Keeps a lot of condensation inside, even if you remove the filter right after brewing.  Programming works well, water filter a plus.So... Not as good as I'd hope from reading many reviews, but that may be due to my preference for really strong coffee."
DCSinger,4.0,"December 31, 2011","I purchased this after reading other reviews and because of a good review in Consumer Reports.  It is easy to use and I like the brew select button.  It did take a bit for the chemical/burned plastic smell to go away; maybe 3 days of use.  And we did as directed, flush it out with white vinegar before using it and brewing the first pot.  What I don't like about ANY of the drip coffee makers is that they never seem to get hot enough.  After brewing the pot and pouring a cup right away, I always have to nuke it in the microwave for 10-15 seconds before it's the right temperature for me.  Otherwise, it was easy to use and brews a good cup if you have a quality coffee to start with."
Mommy of 4,5.0,"June 2, 2015",I love this coffee pot.  I have one problem however which is easily fixed after 4 months it slows in the brewing process.  It is easily fixed with a water vinegar mix however but I have to remember to do it.  This may be due to hard water but my other pots in the past have not slowed as much as this one.  The features are great however so I still give it 5 stars.
Clay,3.0,"February 19, 2014","This coffee maker is a decent, affordable purchase for me. I got a great price. I needed a coffee maker, because the one I had for 8 years finally failed. (my fault) I'm not sure why, but the coffee does not taste as good as with the old maker. Maybe it is just me, but my theory is that it is not brewed with as hot as water. The coffee it makes is satisfying though, so i'm good with the Mr. Coffee."
Karen,2.0,"January 9, 2014","1/9/2014. Started the coffee maker this morning. Nothing. Tried other things in the outlet; they worked. Tried the coffee maker in another working outlet; nothing.  Coffee maker didn't even last six months, although I will say that while it lasted, the coffee was good thus at least a two-star rating. Even at a low end $30, I'd expect more than six months since we only make a pot of coffee every other day for just the two of us."
K.F. Robinson,4.0,"December 23, 2013","We seem to go through coffee makers quickly in our house.  After reading the reviews on this machine we decided to get it along with the thermal carafe.  I only rated it four stars because the ""strong brew"" button doesn't work.  If we use the thermal carafe it won't even brew if we use the ""strong"" setting.  If we use the glass carafe it will beep at us and then brew its regular brew."
E. Jones,4.0,"September 3, 2015","Great coffee pot for the price.  A little confusing on how to set the programmable timer. The first few times we brewed, especially with the included filter pad in  place, it spilled over the filter area and got grounds in the coffee.  Not so common any longer, but have to be very careful to set the filter and carafe in place ""just so""."
Sean Beegle,1.0,"December 28, 2015","Lasted less then 6 months. Also had issues with the coffee pot not being completely matted with dispensing apparatus.  This caused all the coffee water to go around the filter casuing lots of ground coffee to make it into the pot. Would not recommend anyone purchase, was a waste of money."
Scooter,5.0,"December 21, 2015","Product stopped working after about 60 days. I groaned at the thought of dealing with warranty service during the holiday season. I called for warranty service and was impressed way beyond my expectations of getting it fixed. A few short minutes on the phone and they said they would send a new one out right away. They said when replacement arrived to cut off the plug on the old unit and throw the unit out. I got the new unit within a week. WOW! This is great service, thank you!"
DF,3.0,"March 14, 2016","Sadly, after 9 months this coffee maker simply stopped working.  We make 1 pot every day.  There was no Prelude to it quitting.  Just stopped.  Plugged and unplugged to no avail.  The lights work and that's all.  I give it 3 stars because it was good for the time it worked."
JP in KC,5.0,"August 30, 2013","Looks great on the counter and makes a really good cup of coffee.  The delayed brewing timer is very intuitive and easy to set so you can wake up to a fresh cup of coffee before heading off to work in the morning.  I like my coffee fairly strong so the Strong brew feature is a nice plus for me.  Top rated by Consumer Reports for brewing temp and features.  Works as well as a lot of the trendy, high-end coffeemakers at a fraction of the cost; you can spend a lot for a good coffee-maker- but, you don't have to."
SMS,1.0,"October 19, 2015","My husband and I have gone through TWO of these coffee makers in the past year! We certainly aren't overusing it or using it incorrectly. We make one or two pots in the morning - that's it. Yet, with both purchases, after only a few months the water tube seemed to stop working, resulting in an extremely slow brew. We don't live in a place with hard water or anything and we never saw a clog in the tubing; it just seemed like the suction of water was greatly reduced. Anyway, we're going to switch to a different coffee maker for our third attemp!"
Doug Boreland,3.0,"November 4, 2014","Up until it's failure, it was great (5 stars).  Turned it on this morning (1 yr, 1 month after purchase) and it will not pump the water.  I can hear it clicking, trying to turn on, but that's it.  Nothing much more disappointing than a cold morning with no coffee!  This should have lasted much longer.  Previous units by different manufacturers lasted for several years."
tjv,4.0,"October 16, 2015",What I can I say about a coffee maker that does it's job?!The coffee tastes fine and the appliance has not come alive in the middle of the night and tried to kill me which is nice.It is a rather attractive unit. For the price I can't imagine there is anything better. It makes good coffee and looks sharp doing it.It did come with a little filter disk which is a nice novelty but they only last a month. I think a water filter would be more economic and practical...
Mr Beal,4.0,"January 23, 2014","BUT, the operation and user manual are not the same.  There is a light that does not perform as described.  I contacted the company through email, but they ignored it.  As I did some research, I found everybody had the same problem.  It's no biggie in terms of using the product, but either the product needs to be fixed, or the user manual fixed.  If you are consider this aginist the Black and Decker similar product, buy this.  The B&D carafe LEAKS every time you pour from it."
Duane Myers,5.0,"May 13, 2013","Have had this for about a month now and have had no problems.  It is fast and makes good coffee.  I use the strong setting and now use up less coffee, which is a money saver.  The controls are easy and filling the machine with water and coffee grounds is easy too.  I like the caraffe with the metal band at the bottom and no plastic rim around the top.  It's easier to clean that way.  The coffee tastes great."
Amazon Customer,4.0,"October 3, 2012","I have purchased many a coffeemaker over the years, and my main complaints were always the same: too expensive, coffee not hot enough, difficult to clean, etc.  But FINALLY, I have one that does what it should, and does it very well.  I recommend this model to anyone who has been looking for good, hot, and easy coffee that doesn't cost you a fortune per cup the way those ""single-cup-pod-style"" makers do.  As far as the ""plastic smell"" others have complained about, I performed a standard vinegar & water cleaning twice after I unboxed it, and the odor is all gone."
vp,5.0,"March 8, 2015","I am satisfied with Mr. Coffee. I just ordered another one for my job. I followed the start up instructions as directed, and so far its doing great. this would make my third Mr. Coffee machine I have purchased in the past 15 years. I have tried to switch brands, but was unsuccessful and found myself going back to old faithful. what is special about these coffee makers is the more you use them, the better the flavor of the coffee. so you have to give them a little time to break in. this was typical for all three models I have owned. great purchase for the money, you wont find this price any where else."
Carol,4.0,"September 2, 2012","When my Bunn coffee maker started to leak, I knew it was time for a new one.  Since I did not want to spend that kind of money (the Bunn was a gift) I wanted one just as good but not as expensive.  Luckily, I saw a review for"
Arlen Lamont,3.0,"April 21, 2014","Again, I think I may have expected more than this drip coffee maker can deliver.  If you follow the directions, you get a cup of coffee that will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck.  I used 48 ounces of Folger's coffee over the course of a month, and never did get a good cuppa.  I tried every conceivable combination of pot size, coffee/cup but I just couldn't make a good pot."
Frankbury,4.0,"February 13, 2013",Instruction Manual has a way to go to eliminate confusion on setting up the programing for later brewing.I would like to see the lifetime brewing basket as being included.The LED display is very hard to view even in a well lighted environment.The brewer works and gives a great cup of coffee. It maintains a great holding temperature and auto shuts off after two hoursWith all being said the brew is great!
K Cassidy,3.0,"March 22, 2018","This was my favorite coffee maker I’ve ever owned. Sadly, it quit brewing after less than 2 years of use. I am purchasing another one because it was so easy to use, but I am disappointed it didn’t last longer."
Paulette Wallette,1.0,"September 24, 2016",Just because I ordered this last month doesn't mean I used it as soon as it came in! I used this coffee pot for the first time this morning and it leaked from the bottom all over my counter! I can't send it back because I had it over a month! What a piece of crap! NOT HAPPY WITH THE COFFEE POT!
Dell,1.0,"June 3, 2016","Purchased this pot on Sept. 2, 2015 and today it just quit in the middle of brewing a pot. Should have known there was something wrong with the brewing cycle because the little bell(?) signifying the finish of a cycle would go off very early instead of at the end. Now shopping for a different brand."
Joseph,5.0,"August 19, 2015","After replacing my old and a bit wore out coffee maker Mr. Coffee FTX41 model, I decide to give this model a try since i wasn't looking to spend to much for one. After receiving new model, I followed the instructions by cleaning it, since that was the main part to do so you don't get that old taste when you brew your coffee. After all that, I been satisfy with this model for about 2 months ago. So cant go wrong buying this model f your looking for a really good affordable coffee maker"
Bernice,4.0,"March 2, 2013","Great coffee maker, makes good coffee and is an excellent value for the price.  I purchased it based on Consumer Reports.Two major issues are the digital clock, which is almost impossible to read due t its angle and the fact it is not backlit.  The second issue is the labeling of the functions are difficult to read.  I would rate this item a 5 star+ if the forementioned issues were updated with a future model."
Nerg McBerglesworth,2.0,"January 15, 2014","Had this less than a week. The coffee tasted weak and cheap, even though the same coffee tasted great in my cheap Gevalia maker before it broke. The strong feature didn't work out of the box as many, many others have said. It does look nice, though. Needing to use the charcoal disk for even water distribution is a huge minus in my book and a cheap sales ploy to keep you buying disks."
Samwise Holmes,3.0,"August 7, 2014","I bought this coffee maker because it was well-rated on here and by Consumer Reports. There are plenty of coffee makers that are well-rated though, and we bought this one in particular because it states in its description that it has a self-cleaning cycle. This is a lie. I am currently deciding whether to formally complain about the false advertising."
Tom Nye,5.0,"August 31, 2019","Purchased my first one 10 years ago and still going strong, so purchased another for my RV. Easy to use and easy to set timer to wake to the smell of fresh coffee. A++"
K. Gilbert,5.0,"April 30, 2014","Bought this to replace a single cup K-Cup machine as our primary coffee maker (which worked well for just us two, but with a baby on the way, we wanted something that could make larger amounts of coffee at a time for guests, and us in the morning as we'd have to be able to function after being up all night with a fussy baby in those early weeks especially).  This product's price was right what we really wanted to spend.  Nothing too fancy, but we're fine with that.  Can brew strong or regular, can set it up to delay brew, etc.  We've been very pleased with it thus far."
Aerobic Queen,5.0,"January 19, 2014","I bought this coffeemaker to replace a Krups that starting leaking water from the bottom. This coffeemaker makes a great cup of coffee. I have had no problems with any plastic taste. In order to have a great cup of coffee you need the right kind of water and the right coffee. I use water from my Brita filter and I use Kirkland Columbian Supreme(from Costco). And, I put the brew control on strong. I only drink 2 cups of coffee a day(6 oz.) so I wouldn't call myself a coffee maven...but this coffeemaker fills the bill."
Tom Carew,3.0,"December 24, 2014","The coffee maker  is stylish and works well.  The features make it a desirable coffee maker for the price.One bad comment:  The clock light does not light up, and according to Mr. Coffee this model will not.  It seems like for the features and the modern style, a simple LED could have been incorporated, makes the clock useless if you can't see it, hard to program the delay feature."
James L. Johnson,1.0,"August 25, 2015","30 years ago I bought a ""Mr. Coffee""  It lasted a little over a year.  Then the heating element went out.  I said I'd never buy a Mr. Coffee again.  Well, I did and less that 6 months later the heating element went out.  First time, ""Shame on you""  Second time ""Shame on me""."
CWeiss,5.0,"August 22, 2015","Very happy with coffee maker, easy to use, love the deep brew option for darker coffee, the timer is easy to set up and I love the look of this.  We left the one cup coffee pod world and went back to bigger brews.  I only wish there was a channeled filter instead of the big flat bottom type filter, but still very happy with the machine."
KOry,4.0,"March 2, 2015","I bought my Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable coffee maker to replace an older machine.A simple search of the internet brought back good reviews of this model and so far two weeks plus into serviceit holds up.  The price was very attractive, obviously more expensive models give more options but for just plainole weekday service it meets my needs."
Shell1952,3.0,"February 21, 2016","We've had this coffee maker for a little over a year.  It worked great yesterday, then today nothing.  I suppose for the price that's not too bad.  We've always bought Mr. Coffee with good results, but they last much longer than this one.  It's a disposable world!"
Syl,5.0,"July 7, 2014","I'm 77 an this is one of the best coffee pots I've had in years. I use to buy Mr. Coffee all the time till they became the worse. But wow was I surprise an pleased to find they have returned to being the best now. It's easy, fast an makes great coffee. By all means buy one. Can't beat the quality for the price! Kudos to Mr. Coffee company!"
mke53233,5.0,"May 12, 2014","I work in an office, and our last coffeemaker was on its last legs.  We purchased this, because it can be set to delay brewing, which is a feature the boss insisted upon.  We thought the coffee was a bit weak on the standard setting compared to the same amount of grounds versus our old coffeemaker, but we set the brew setting to be stronger, and it fixed that.  Happy with the purchase thus far."
Megan Plog,5.0,"March 15, 2015",Do you love coffee? Do you love the smell of coffee wafting into your bedroom before you are fully awake? If you answered YES to at least ONE of the previous questions then you are in luck! This coffee pot is AWESOME! You can program it to start brewing coffee before you wake up so you can enjoy a fresh cup right as your wretched alarm goes off. The coffee stays HOT and it does a great job of making consistent pots of coffee that you will enjoy. BON APETITE!
Tim,5.0,"July 22, 2015","Every bit as good as the very good Braun it replaced. I will never over-spend on a coffee maker again. Every feature I need, this has. I've noticed in some reviews, they note the 'strong' button doesn't work. I have a newer model (those reviews are a couple of years old), and mine works just fine."
Vera DeGroote,3.0,"November 5, 2015","I just received my Coffeemaker and guess what - no wire filter, no paper filter. This should be CLEARLY stated so that one knows to buy the basket or the filters. Several reviews say the filter came with the coffeemaker. I ordered the basket now altho I am upset it wasn't clear."
Selmer,5.0,"December 26, 2013","I cannot comment on all the timer features as I have not used them, I just grind the coffee and push the buttons. I've had the machine 3 weeks; it's easy to use and makes a good cup of coffee. That's all I want from a coffee maker. It has an auto shut-off after 2 hrs, which is a plus for me also. It does take up a lot of room on the counter top, but no big deal, so far so good."
Fred,4.0,"February 16, 2015","Works well.  The water window is on the wrong side for my application.  It would be better if it were on the left or both sides.  The step on the left side indicating maximum for glass or thermal help.  Coffee grounds float / overflow when making 12 cups so, I will cut back to a maximum of 10 and see if that helps."
J. Treg,5.0,"March 30, 2016","I have used Mr Coffee for many years, and love their features.  This one, in particular, is fabulous.First - it has a ""Strong Brew"" setting.  That is a slower cycle that allows coffee water to sit in the grounds a little longer before the next rain of water.  This results in a full-bodied cup of coffee, and allows one to use LESS coffee.  Therefore, you have a lower cost of ownership through its life.Second - this coffeemaker can use the Stainless Steel thermos pot - but are limited to 8 cups at a time!  --"
B Troxler,4.0,"September 20, 2015",Great quality for the price and it seems to make good coffee.  A bit of plastic taste in the first cups so take the manual's advice and clean it thoroughly then run a few pots of water through before your first brew.  Should have bought the permanent filter with it.  Also bought the thermal pot.  A very good combination.
Shirley Christopherson,5.0,"February 22, 2015","After our Kurieg died it was time to buy another coffee maker.  we took 2 back, as one was bitter coffee, and other water not hot enough,  I read the reviews on this one, and I am thankful for people posting here and rating products.  We purchased this and for the money, you can't go wrong!!!  Great tasting coffee, hot, just a good machine!!1"
B. Fowler,5.0,"September 22, 2011","Our old coffee pot died suddenly and I had little time to shop, so I consulted Consumer's Report on coffee pots and checked on Amazon's website.  I ordered the one recommended, it quickly arrived in the mail, we started using it and haven't had any problems.  My husband likes the feature that allows you to make coffee ""regular"" or ""strong"".  We like the design and are completely happy with the purchase."
Freebird,2.0,"July 24, 2016","This is an attractive coffee maker.  We use it daily.  It worked very nicely for about the first 6 months, but then started to slow down.  After just under a year of use, it is painfully slow.  Trying to find a solution, or we'll just buy a new one.  A coffee maker should last well over one year."
Michele,4.0,"September 23, 2014",The only problem I've had with this coffee maker is some overflowing when I don't perfectly align the basket. It was very aggravating the first few times it happened until I figured out the problem but all is now good. I like the timer which allows me to have my coffee ready when I hop out of bed. It's a good machine for the price. Overall I'm pleased.
Frederick H Davis,5.0,"January 20, 2015","What can you say? It's a Mr Coffee. It makes the coffee. The thing I like most, though, is I've had a Black and Decker and managed to spill coffee all over everything. How tough can it be to make a pot that doesn't dribble coffee everywhere? Apparently Mr Coffee has mastered the art."
Adrienne Young,2.0,"January 30, 2017","I really enjoyed this in the beginning, I took excellent care of this machine. It was quiet and brewed great tasting coffee. However, 7 months after my purchased it started letting out a strange odor and the pot would spit water everywhere and then suddenly stopped brewing. I will never purchase this machine again."
Terrie L. Robbins,5.0,"April 5, 2015","Cheap. Does the trick. No complaints. Does set your house on fire like the last two Cuisinart Dcc 1200 did. Truly. Two machines had smoking shorts after two years and I read reviews about the same from others. So I decided a cheap Mr. Coffee might be serviceable and didn't have bad reviews. Nothing fancy, but price/value is great!!!!"
C Jones,4.0,"November 23, 2013",I bought this due to the ratings. I had the less expensive Mr. Coffee twice and it broke after a couple of years each time.  This product makes excellent coffee but the basket has 2 filters and the water pump turns back and forth to load and unload the coffee basket.  I am finding that a bit annoying but not enough so to return it. I am hoping this lasts more than 2 years.
R. Walter,5.0,"May 3, 2014","Our last Mr. Coffee gave us about 6 faithful years until the pump failed recently.  Consumer Reports gave this model marks similar to a $200 model.  Definitely like how the top lifts so you can pour the water in, even when droopy eyed and in need of coffee in the morning!  It is also stylish. The carafe is shaped nicely for pouring. Can't beat the price, get one!"
Rick,4.0,"December 22, 2011",Bought this coffeemaker due to good review by leading consumer magazine.  It works well but the pot is a little difficult to wash out well as the lid does not detatch like my previous Braun did.  Also the screen/controls are not backlit so one has to use it in a well lighted area and cannot see the clock in the dark.  Backlighting would be a design improvement as would be a detachable lid on the pot.  If it lasts as long as the Braun did I'll be well satisfied.
Frances,5.0,"January 20, 2015","Love it!  A timer rings when the coffee is brewed and then again when the two hour holding time of over.  Coffee is consistently good and hot whether brewed as regular or strong.  The coffee pot spout never drips or runs over the sides when pouring, the basket is easy to remove and replace, and the machine takes up very little counter space.  Easy, convenient, and as advertised."
NYCSteeler,5.0,"August 13, 2016","My wife broke the decanter from our old Mr. Coffee machine and rather than pay $18 for a replacement decanter, it made more sense to spend $30 and get a new machine. It works extrmely well; program it for the morning and the aroma of coffee permeates the house at 6am, nice."
Daniel,1.0,"March 3, 2016","I don't typically write reviews and have never written a bad one, but I felt I had to for this one. I used this coffee maker multiple times a day, everyday, for over a week and I was dissatisfied with every cup. I kept using it, giving it the benefit of the doubt and to not be rash, but it never improved. The coffee was always weak, no matter the coffee/water ratio, even despite the ""strong brew"" setting. The convenience of automatic/delayed brew did not outweigh the problem of weak coffee, unfortunately."
Casey,5.0,"December 18, 2013","We bought this after seeing its high ratings on the CR website. Dollar for dollar, this was the best deal available for brew quality and durability. So far, so good. We upgraded to the permanent filter and also bought the SS carafe along with the machine, and both are good products. The brew time on this unit seems slow, but the quality of the coffee is worth the wait."
Lindsey,4.0,"March 17, 2014",My father in law has had a horrible little 4 cup coffee maker for as long as ive know him so we wanted to get him something bigger and better without spending $50 to $75 bucks.  All the cheaper machines I looked at either werent programmable or simply looked very very cheap.  I found this one and bought it instantly.  He really enjoys it and says it brews much faster than that old one had.  Cant go wrong for the price.
Monica,5.0,"December 20, 2018",I have this coffee maker and it just died. After 5 years. I hold no ill will. I’m ordering the exact same one again. Long live Mr. Coffee!
AMeador1,3.0,"July 30, 2015","We had another Mr. Coffee unit before (it's heating element die a week ago - after 2 or 3 years of use). It had a backlit clock - which this unit does not. I hoped it would still be clearly visible - but no, it's almost non-seeable on our counter top. Also, when our old unit finished brewing, it automatically changed from showing the clock to how long since the coffee had been brewed - and thus about how long the warming plate would still remain on. This unit does not do this. If you want to see the amount of time passed since brewing, you have to manually hit a button to switch back and forth between the clock and timer. This is a simple, but practical feature that would be nice to have on this unit. Our unit let you switch between 2 hours and 4 hours for the warming plate to stay on - this unit does not. It is 2 hours only. And lastly, our previous unit allowed for setting the temperature of the warming plate - but not this unit.You also have to buy the permanent filter separately. I made a mistake in thinking it came with the unit, so I had to order it separately.If I could have found my other unit on here, I would have re-bought it, but I couldn't find it and ended up ordering this unit. It's not bad, but I know what they are capable of. I wish they would step it up a little on this model - especially when some of these lacking features are simply a matter of programming code used to run the unit - so you're talking about a few more lines of code to improve the unit. Too bad.UPDATE:A few days after getting this unit - it died. I hadn't even gotten to use the permanent filter I ordered for it. Amazon was great about handling the return and credits, and I know new units of anything will sometimes fail, but this just adds insult to injury. For this reason I have deducted another star on my rating of the unit."
DMK,2.0,"September 30, 2014","Thought I was going to love this but----the arm where the water drips out into the filter is unusual you have to make sure you turn it into the filter never saw one like this before. I always have to think "" did I move it in its proper place""? It also takes 10 minutes to brew which I can live with but it is kind of loud plus the 3 beeps to signal it's done brewing is very loud. I will keep this as it's very easy to fill the reservoir which I was wanting."
DBS,4.0,"January 18, 2014",The features are great and it is relatively simple to set up when you program the functions. It's a robust machine but doesn't take over your counter space and fits nicely under your cabinets. I don't have a large kitchen with a lot of counter space so this was important for me to find a small and feature loaded machine that would fit. Haven't had for every long but so far I am very pleased with it.
Sunflower,1.0,"March 23, 2013","This coffee maker makes tasteless, unenjoyable coffee. No matter how much coffee I use, it tastes like nothing, despite having turned on "" strong"" coffee. It only gets bitter but that's it. I think the problem is, that this filter system ( the cone one is much better) lets water run too fast through the coffee ground, and therefore, the water cannot get the aroma out of the coffee. I will get rid of this coffee maker and buy myself  a bit pricier  one. Unfortunately, I don't have the paper receipt anymore, otherwise this maschine would have been returned right away. 50$ for this coffee maker is a joke. Maybe 15,99 , but that's it. I should have know it better."
Doris,5.0,"January 17, 2014","I know a lot of people have to have fancy coffee makers. I'm not one of them. I picked this coffee maker because it is easy to use, easy to clean and makes a good cup of coffee as long as the coffee you put in is good. I was looking for simple and efficient and this product meets my needs to perfection. AND the glass container pours coffee without spilling!!!"
Jean LeJerq,2.0,"July 26, 2016","Saw this with great reviews in some places (and low price), but a note that with so much electronics there could be repair problem.  Figured, what's to break, when all I do is pour in water, put coffee in basket and push the ""on"" button.  Like a lamp, right?  Well something broke, after about a year.  Hit the ""on"" button and all the lights come on (and the burner) but no brewing happens.  A one-year life for something so simple is nonsense.  The Cuisineart that I have at home has been problem free for at least a dozen years."
julieofaz,2.0,"August 20, 2015","Meh. It is a coffee maker. I find that the coffee is very weak, even when brewing with the 'strong' setting. I have been using the same soffe brand so I know it is the machine. A good value but I don't love it. It is a shiny chrome and not a brushed finish as I thought it would be."
Tracy Bates,5.0,"April 25, 2014","I did quite a bit of research before buying this coffee pot. The last 2 kinds I purchased barely lasted 2 years each. I also didn't want to purchase something as expensive as a Bunn. This coffee pot is amazing. It makes the best tasting coffee I have ever had! I make it the same, it just tastes so much better! Easy to use and stylish to sit on my counter!"
Amazon Customer,1.0,"April 20, 2016","Mine worked great for 4 months. broke when I forgot to put the pot into the coffee maker this morning, coffee spilled everywhere and gf set it upside down to drain coffee/water out of it. The lcd display/button area isnt very well protected and water easily seeps into it if this unit is inverted. I wouldn't exactly call this design durable."
Rude dog,5.0,"February 7, 2013","All my previous coffeemaker had 2 problems. 1st and the worst. The heating plate would scorch and look ugly not this one, so far.  2nd pouring of your coffee from the cafre, the drips and spills. This one so far zero drips and no mess. I STRONGLY RECCOMMED THIS to a friend or family member. I use the cofffeemaker every day without fail. 1 small drawback the clock is hard to see, no biggie for me. The BEST part my wife LOVES IT, enough said"
Pat Girard,5.0,"February 20, 2015","Love this coffee maker. I felt that for the features available with this coffee maker, the price was more than reasonable. I like that it brews much slower than my old coffee maker, making the coffee taste so much better. The only problem I have is that it did not come with a permanent filter basket, which should have been included."
JZ53,5.0,"December 26, 2014","We've had this coffee maker for several years and has been the best one we've ever purchased. With the water filter on top of the basked, the paper filter never collapses, which has always been an issue before. We like this one so much, I purchased one just like it for my mom, who also loves it. It's easy to program so the coffee is always ready when I get up for in the morning."
Cait Hayward,5.0,"March 13, 2015","love this coffee pot! it looks way more expensive than it was. its easy to use, has a water filter, the timer works great and the strong setting is AWESOME! i work from home, so strong coffee is a must all day. this is a great coffee pot and i will replace it with the same one when it goes. Also purchased the permanent filter."
G. M. Van Damm,3.0,"February 16, 2013","After 5 months of ownership, brew became weak.  At first, I thought it was the coffee I was using, which has been very consistent over the years.  The machine is well maintained, cleaned at least every 6 weeks according to manufacturer's directions.  On a whim, as it was brewing, I opened the top, and noticed the coffee grounds were not consistently and evenly being covered with hot water.  I wrote to the warranty company to advise the issue, and as of this moment, have not heard from them, although I'm assuming the coffeemaker is a 12 month warranty.  So because I don't believe in the K-Cup frenzy, I purchased a Cuisinart, with the water delivery system via a virtual shower head, and my coffee is now at the superb level I expect.  Based on this particular product, even though it is highly rated, I would consider an alternatively higher rated but more consistent alternative.  The machine should deliver a consistent result for at least a year."
Ja,2.0,"February 25, 2016","I'm really not sure how this thing got so many excellent reviews as I really don't like it at all. I bought this after our Cuisinart died after 10 years of service and thought I would save some money with this Mr. Coffee maker. Well, it does make coffee and thats about where the good points stop. Let's start with the instructions... you get a little paper booklet with no illustrations at all. This normally would not be an issue but I could not figure out where the much hyped water filter installed so I had to read through this badly translated text which still didn't explain where this little round filter disc went. I finally figured out that it just sits on top of the filter basket and supposedly filters the hot water that trickle out of the nozzle onto the coffee grounds and paper filter. This is a terrible design as half the time it falls down into the basket and doesn't filter anything, not to mention you have to remove this thing every time you make a new pot of coffee. This leads me to the next item... the hot water arm that has to be moved out of the way every time you refill the coffee filter and grounds then moved back into position. This works but it is an inconvenience. The next thing is the pause feature... this does NOT work at all. If you remove the pot before it finishes it WILL keep dripping coffee all over the burner causing smoking, sizzling, and popping. Another thing that really annoys me is that the coffee is not hot enough to melt the creamer when it first brews. You must wait about 15 minutes or so for the burner to heat the coffee up to the right temperature. The last thing that bothers me is that steam leaks around all the seams and creates water droplets on the outside which gather and drip down the sides. This gets our wooden tray where the maker sits all wet. This is a really bad design and we will be spending the extra money for another Cuisinart."
JERRY DUFFY,2.0,"April 15, 2016","wear your glasses to start this with all the option buttons! Only for right handed user as filler door opens and blocks left side. No filter papers included, not even 1 ! Requires user to rotate filler spout before each use. Not very well engineered."
Booter 1%er,3.0,"December 1, 2014","We bout this to replace our Cuisinart that was starting to go.  Makes a good cup of coffee, but it seems to take a long time to brew (about 15 min), and I wish it kept the coffee a little hotter, or had a temp adjustment for the hot plate, but for a relatively inexpensive, name brand coffee maker, I'm happy with it."
Dwayne T.,5.0,"November 3, 2015","I got this for my mother for a Christmas gift, it was a lightening deal.  She loved it. She is 59 and this coffee maker by Mr coffee was very easy for her to set up and use right away. If you are looking for a coffee maker that's easy to use and makes more than 1 cup at a timw, then this is for you."
Watson,5.0,"December 25, 2013",This coffee maker is fantastic. It makes great coffee and is very easy to use. It is inexpensive yet has all the features of the more expensive coffee makers. It is very easy to clean and maintain. I would definitely recommend this appliance. Be careful to order this machine however as there are some Mr. Coffee machines that are not rated at all as well.
C. Phillips,4.0,"December 14, 2011","This is a nice coffee maker. My husband likes programmable, and I like that it has the feature my old one had where you could choose a longer brew cycle and get stronger coffee, saving on coffee grounds. Plus this is a sexy machine! It fits perfectly under my cabinet and I can still open the top, but I gave it a four as the fill indicator is on the side, so I have to pull the unit out anyway to fill it. Regardless, I would recommend this unit to anyone."
Barbara H. Mathiews,5.0,"December 30, 2012","I had bought another coffeemaker and it leaked it was a different brand so I sent it back and got this one...I love this one so much better, easy to fill and it looks very expensive but, its not ..it makes great coffee and is easy to clean and you have options if you want stronger coffee but, we like the regular best. I has a filter basket you can use paper filters so I like that. We love this coffeemaker very much."
BIGMAC,3.0,"March 5, 2015",this product has already died..the Mr. Coffee will no longer make coffee. I want to return it for a replacement or refund since it's defective but not sure Amazon will allow me to do this. If not I will no longer be a prime member that's for sure. I've been a prime member for over 5yrs now..
Sean O.,2.0,"April 2, 2016","Ordered this to keep my unit going while deployed, the product stopped working after less then two months of use. Customer service told me that they cold not not help me because I am deployed to Afghanistan. When it worked, it was great."
fastercars,2.0,"April 25, 2016","I loved my old Mr. Coffee 12-cup machine and the great tasting coffee it made. So I bought this new one. I followed the Mr. Coffee instructions to the letter. Then, with eager anticipation, I made my first cup of coffee. Very disappointing and somewhat unbelievable -- the coffee had a plastic taste to it. Now I've read the questions and answers here and see that other people have had the same problem."
Jayde,1.0,"November 16, 2015","I purchased this machine back in June 2015. It worked great. Made coffee, coffee tasted good, easy to clean, etc. Life was great. Except all of a sudden I go to make coffee and there are grinds EVERYWHERE, the machine won't heat up water and the hot plate won't get hot. It's less than 6 months old. It isn't an overly used coffee machine so it should have lasted longer. NOT HAPPY AT ALL!"
Stella,5.0,"December 2, 2011","I was going to buy a Keurig but read so many negative reviews. Just looking for something for my office. Decided to see what Consumer Reports liked and they rated this coffeemaker very highly. Love Amazon's price, as always. Have used it one week now and it's great except.... no way to override the 2-hour shutoff on the warmer. Darn. Oh well, for under $30 I have nothing to complain about!"
Amazon Customer,5.0,"July 3, 2013","I never figured out why that was such a design challenge, but it obviously was.  It's is the first coffee pot in a ridiculous number of years that didn't dribble when I poured.  ...and yes, the coffee tastes good and the timer is accurate, and the time and delay settings are easier than most, to set.  This is a great coffee maker, and it's cheap. What's not to like?"
country girl,5.0,"September 26, 2015",Very satisfied with this coffee maker.  The coffee is kept very hot (my husband doesn't have to warm it in the microwave like he did with our other coffee maker). The timer is easy to set and the coffee is great.  It looks great and a great price.  No problems to report after using it about 4 months.
LL,1.0,"September 8, 2015",This coffee maker was good when it worked. But after only 5 months it stopped working. It just won't brew. No water is moving. I tried to take it apart as best as I could to look for clogs but couldn't find anything. What an unreliable piece of garbage. I will never buy Mr. Coffee products ever again.
simmered,5.0,"February 15, 2015",My Cuisinart turned off after brewing so coffee would not stay hot.  Mr Coffee had a good rating in Consumer Reports so decided to change brands. Mr Coffee has a setting for a strong brew and it does a great job plus keeps the coffee hot. It also comes with a replaceable filter for the water that is to be changed monthly; it is optional  I would recommend this coffee maker.
Michael King,1.0,"January 19, 2016",This machine was a huge disappointment! It worked fine for about five brews then stopped. First it stayed in brew mode but wouldn't move the water through the filter then it stopped working entirely. Very displeased!
W. OGrady,4.0,"February 5, 2013","After years of trying various European coffeemakers and not being happy with any of them, I decided to give Mr. Coffee a try and have not been disappointed.  And a single coffeemaker that lets you use either a glass or a thermal carafe is a great idea.  I use both ------ the thermal for multiple cups and the glass for small quantities ----- and really like the concept.  And both carafes pour without dripping!  (Why is that so hard to figure out????)  The coffee is good and consistent, and the coffeemaker is easy to set up.  I haven't experienced the difficulty with filling the water basin that some have commented on.  So far, I'm really happy with it."
Charles Lee,3.0,"June 10, 2013","My 15 year old Braun coffee maker died and I replaced it with a Mr Coffee unit, the Consumers Union No 1 pick.  It works as advertised; however, the coffee is not as tasty (rich) as my old unit even though I use more coffee and select the stronger setting. The molded plastic top is overly complicated and is next to impossible to wipe dry with all its incorporated nooks & crannies.  I use a permanent Mr Coffee gold-tone filter and I notice that its hole size is smaller than the hole size of the filter which I used for our old Braun unit.  I get less sediment with the Mr Coffee and less rich coffee flavor from the Starbucks French Roast that I use.HENCE, MY AVERAGE RATING."
Mitch G,5.0,"December 29, 2013","I replaced my Kitchen Aid Pro Line coffer maker ($200++) with this and I could not be happier. Of dozens of coffee makers reviewed by Consumer Reports magazine, this was 2nd or 3rd highest rated. They were right. Yes it seems flimsy when compared to the Kitchen Aid and other top of line machine which I have used over the years, but its design is more than adequate for the task at hand and I have used it daily since I purchased it months ago."
Levi Alexander,1.0,"April 4, 2016",It worked great and had lots of cool options but quit working after about six months. The light still comes on but the warmer is cold and it won't brew. Not something I wanted to deal with on a Monday morning. Guess I should have listened to the other reviewers.
Matthew R. Elliott,5.0,"February 8, 2015","Makes very good and hot coffee. So far it's living up to its reputation by way of Consumer Reports which rated it high for overall performance.  Time will tell whether it lasts.  I've read a few reviews that the pump stops working too soon. In fact my last Mr. Coffee machine (not this model) did just that after about five years. To me that's too soon for any machine to completely crap out. On the other hand, unlike some of its tonier competitor brands, the price is definitely right.I paired this with the DRD95 8-cup Stainless Steel carafe which works well together."
Julie Grm,1.0,"November 9, 2014",I bought this coffee pot for our condo in Florida where we spend 6 months. It worked great but the bottom part fell out of the basket-- the part that allows you to pour the coffee from the decanter before the coffee is done. I am disappointed. I have had this same coffee pot up north for quite a number of years of daily use with no problem.  It's a great pot but I must have gotton a bad one. I wish I could get a replacement basket but the manual does not list that as a part you can get.
Judith,5.0,"January 8, 2014",I had considered a 6-Cup coffeemaker but decided to go ahead and purchase the 12-Cup instead.  I brew enough for a 2-Cup serving for myself but thought I would get the 12-Cup when I have guest.  This coffeemaker works well for a 2-Cup serving.  It is easy to fill and makes a hot cup of coffee.  Very good product especially when considering the price.
Roy,5.0,"November 17, 2014","This is easy to use, easy to clean.  Makes great coffee.  Simple, without the (unnecessary, in my opinion) crazy extras that some manufacturers seem to think people want.  The programming feature is easy to use and works well.  Digital read out is easy to see.  Fairly intuitive buttons make it easy."
R. Williams,3.0,"March 7, 2016",The instructions are not clear as far as where to place the water spout. I got this for when I have multiple guest that drink coffee. It doesn't come with a filter and makes coffee OK. I like strong coffee and the strong option doesn't do justice.
DooDSTeR,4.0,"March 26, 2014","Frankly, I am so sick and tired of buying expensive coffee machines, like Cuisinart, and have them die young, sudden deaths. It's happened so many times. Mr. Coffee machines have been a kitchen standard for a reason ... they're affordable workhorses and the coffee tastes great and stays warm. Finally a machine that makes HOT coffee. Carumba! :)"
andy,2.0,"February 23, 2014","If you enjoy a very average cup of coffee, well this one is for you! All of the positively reviewed features are just as they are described. It just doesn't make good tasting coffee unless you double the amount of grounds you use, and even then it is still average. The ""bold"" option does provide a slower average cup of coffee, but not better. I sent mine back."
H. Cats,1.0,"January 6, 2015","I have bought at least 5 coffee makers over the years and this is a piece of garbage. What s dissapointment. It stopped working this morning. I spent $19.99 during the holidays, so excited that I got a deal. (It was one of the lightning deals). I would have sent it back if I had the box but I threw it away. You get what you pay for!"
J B Jernigan,1.0,"June 25, 2016",I completely loved this coffeemaker and agree with the other reviews raving about it. The problem as a few others I read noted. This coffeemaker completely stopped working 11 months after I purchased it. I am very disappointed because I loved it so much I thought of just buying another one but I just cannot. I instead went up to the local store and bought another brand. I cannot give a good review for something that isn't made to last longer than that.
O,2.0,"January 8, 2017",This coffeemaker was working fine for about a year and a half. Then suddenly this morning it just stopped while it was brewing our coffee. The light stayed on but the machine stopped working!! It just died. I definitely would not buy this product again!
Brian + Mackenzie Byersdorf,2.0,"September 5, 2016","Owned the coffee pot for 4 months. Made a 6 cup pot every morning, coffee was pretty good. Especially if I ground it fresh!However, 4 months in and the machine doesn't work any more. Powers in, all electronics appear to work,  but doesn't heat water or pump water... Or make coffee. Liked it while it worked, hence the 2 star review. Would give a 4 otherwise."
rck,1.0,"January 15, 2020",Sent it backDoesn’t keep coffee hot
Anna,1.0,"May 3, 2016",This machine was highly rated by Consumer Reports and considered a great find because of the price.  It was a piece of garbage.  It didn't even last a six months.  Really disappointed in it and  Consumer Reports.  I would recommend paying more and getting something decent.  Mr. Coffee has not been very reliable and I will never buy from them again.  (Unless Alzheimers happens)
KV Adventures,5.0,"January 28, 2016","You would be hard pressed to find a better coffee make for under $30.  In fact this Mr. Coffee maker outperforms units from others costing over $60.  I have been spoiled by how tasty it brews my coffee.  It is always hot from the first cup.  And the second cup is even a bit hotter with the burner heating it up a bit more on this unit.  I actually like having that second cup just a bit too hard to gulp down right away.I also love the ""strong"" brew strength feature and use it most of the time.  Even the regular brew is quite strong.  I've had both the glass and aluminum carafes and far prefer the taste using the glass carafe.  It is also hotter.  (Did I mention I really like HOT coffee?).  I was looking for the best coffee maker (within reason) and THIS is it!  Look no father.  Mr. Coffee is so much better than Cuisinart and Bunn which, I've also owned.Other tips that have really helped me brew that perfect cup:1. Get quality coffee beans (you get what you pay for).2.  Take good care of those beans (get air tight canisters to store them inside).3.  Grind your beans right before you brew them.  Ideally use a burr grinder (I use one by Krups) as they grind the beans slower and don't burn them like some of the quicker grinders will.3. Use the best water you can.  I buy filtered, alkaline water and it improved the taste enormously.  I also use the extra water filter provided in the Mr. Coffee unit and change it out every month or two.  If you do use tap water, make sure you use the extra filters with the Mr. Coffee unit as they do help.Say goodbye to the $2.15 cup of coffee at Starbucks.  If you follow these steps above you can actually out brew any of the fancy coffee places around town.  Life is too short to drink bad coffee.  Treat yourself.  You deserve it!"
iTim,1.0,"June 16, 2017","Bought this 11/2015 and used once daily. Today I came to the kitchen to get my morning coffee and it was dead. There was one inch of coffee in the caraf. The hot plate was not heating. Nothing would make it go, so I won't buy another Mr Coffee again."
Bill K,1.0,"December 25, 2013","I had the coffee maker for a month and used it everyday before finally having to return it.  The machine makes three loud beeps when you turn it on which is fine unless you are setting the timer for it start in the morning.  The beeps are so loud I could hear them upstairs from my bedroom with the door closed.  As far as I could tell, there was no way to disable this feature.Bu ultimately the reason for the return was that the basket that holds the filter would sporadically not work causing overflow and a messy counter.  I made sure that everything was in place and it was not operator error.  It wasn't. I tried placing a weight on top of the machine to hold the lid down and the basket in place.  This worked for a couple of weeks without incident until it overflowed again.  Enough.  I returned it and bought a Black and Decker model from our local super market.  It is not as ""sleek"" looking on the counter, but it works and it makes a decent cup of coffee."
JoanInKC,2.0,"August 16, 2015","For all the hoopla, it makes terrible coffee.  And the multi-step insides, fill basket, put in filter, move arm over, just took longer for not a great result.  I gave my new purchase to my college bound grandson, who was willing to risk 'bad' coffee [over none]."
Dee in Phoenix,5.0,"March 25, 2014","I've had a lot of coffee makers in my life but this is one of the nicer ones.  For the price range you'd have a hard time finding anything with the same quality.  I love the easy to use controls, the ease of making a pot of coffee and not having it drip when you pour it.  I will definitely look for this same one when its time to replace it."
Lady whitecrow,5.0,"November 16, 2015","I purchased this for a friend of mine, and she is extremely pleased with it. She loves the 2 hour shut off feature and tells me it brews faster than any of her previous coffee makers. So I have to give it a A+. If she's happy, I'm happy. Arrived quickly and in perfect working condition."
feldspars,5.0,"February 9, 2015","Bought this cheap coffee pot to replace two Cuisinart coffee makers that were junk.  This doesn't run over, is easy to use, pours the water into the carafe without dripping all over, pours into a mug without dripping and is just excellent.Bought this in 2014 and it is still working perfectly.  Best coffee maker."
Cassandra C.,4.0,"May 8, 2016","I have had this for a while and find that it is a really nice coffee pot for the average coffee drinker, however for me this just does not quite meet my expectations. First off my pot has a bad habit of saying I have the thermal pot in when I have the glass pot on the burner ( I don't have a thermal). The coffee makes fine but I am unsure how this affects the heating of the coffee as the burner does not stay on after the coffee is made. So if you drink coffee off and on it will get cold. Even if you turn the pot back on if it is not making coffee it will turn back off (safety feature I guess). It does tell you how long the coffee has been sitting for but has no way to set a time for how long the pot stays on after coffee is made. I drink coffee all day so it is very annoying for the coffee to get cold. I guess if I had the thermal pot that wouldn't happen so I guess I need to buy that in order to enjoy my coffee all day.  I have had no issues with over filling as you can see how much water you put in and can see where the holes are that drain if you over fill. Just dont fill past the holes. I have had a little problem with the grinds over flowing but that is not a result of a defect in the coffee pot but is because of the amount of grinds I use for my coffee. The waterfilter does help to keep the grinds in the strainer I just have to wash the filter off in between uses.  Over all for the price of this coffee pot you really cant ask for much more than what it does do as it does have a timer to turn the coffee on in the morning, it tells you how long your coffee has been sitting, and it lets you set brew strength, either regular or strong.  Over all for the money a very nice pot but if you are expecting gourmet style results spring for a more expensive pot."
OldHermit,2.0,"December 21, 2015","UPDATED REVIEW:This morning, after 2 cups of coffee, the heater just quit and no more coffee.  I took everything out and cleaned it and did all I could but it is done.  This coffee maker is just shy of 1 1/2 years old and only makes one pot daily when we are home.  Great product if it had been well made.  Still sprays coffee all over if you try to take out pot before it is done perking.  Will try another brand now.  If you buy this product just figure on 1-2 years and you will be happy.I have been using this for about a week now.  It is simple to program and use.  We have to change the ""delay brew"" start time almost daily and it only takes seconds to do that.  The ""strong brew"" setting allows me to use less coffee and still get a strong brew.  The thing I like most about the glass pot is that even if you poor fast it does not dribble, which it seems most do today.  Don't know how long it will last but for now I would not change anything about this design.  There is just not anything to like about this machine.  Well after a month, here is the update on this unit.  The glass pot is very thin and the glass has stained.  It will not wash off.  That in itself does not bother me but it may bother some buyers.  Also, if you remove the pot to pour before it is finished brewing, I have found that it is impossible to remove the pot (fast or slow) and not dribble quite a bit of coffee on the burner before the filter float closes.  That is why I am now changing it to a 4 star."
joseph chapman,5.0,"July 12, 2016","Got this for my parents and they tell me all the time how much they love this coffee maker. So I decided to leave a comment for them, brews quick and makes very very good coffee, going on 2 years and its still pumping that delicious coffee. Highly recommend!"
Ambyr,5.0,"January 15, 2017","Sorry this is a super late review. I've had this coffee maker over yr and it still works great! Gets the water a nice hot temp and simple to use. My roommate's puts her teabags in it makes her tea, so I guess it's multifunctional as well lol."
JHD,5.0,"March 23, 2013","No complaints, really like this little coffee maker....I got rid of my 2nd defective Keurig coffee maker and decided I was done with overpriced, gimmicky machines. I bought this one after reading the reviews. Makes good coffee fairly quickly...really like the ""strong"" brew option. If you want a basic brewer that makes a decent cup of Joe, this is worth a try."
Daneel,4.0,"November 20, 2014","Bought this because it's an identical replacement to my dead one. (I already owned the 8-cup thermal carafe option for this model) I was slightly disappointed with the original machine, as it lasted only about 2-1/2 years. But I'm happy with the seller and shipping time. The unit actually makes some pretty good coffee."
Dean F. Blair,5.0,"January 27, 2014",I bought this for my wife after reading a review of it in Consumer Reports (it got the top rating). She loves this thing (bought her the gold filter too and she loves it) and makes coffee first thing every morning - as soon as she comes downstairs she starts the process - coffee and cinnamon toast. She love the maker so I am happy. Five stars.
Mikey Good Guy,1.0,"January 25, 2014",Unfortunately this model Mr. Coffee works fine but you can't get the smell and taste out of it even after a months use.I read the reviews but discounted them as people who were overly critical but after a month of use and two cleaning each of vinegar and water as well as baking soda and water the problem persists.After you brew coffee the coffee smells and tastes bad and the kitchen smells the same!Do yourself a favor and buy a different model as the low price matches the functionality.
Robert Gonyea,5.0,"December 6, 2013",OK it may be a little thing and that I've spent most of my adult life getting by with a generic coffeemaker.. But the coolest feature ever showed up the first morning I used this.  Set the brew timer to 6:30 AM... It was READY at 6:30 not just starting to brew!!I've stepped into the future with my first robotic butler!
Elizabeth S,3.0,"March 22, 2014","This keeps the coffee hotter than my last Mr. Coffee. A bit slower to brew but the coffee tastes better. The only negative, is in the pause n serve feature,which, when I remove carafe to fill cup, the basket drips every time onto the hot pad below. About 1-2 drips, so coffee drip sizzles on the  warmer plate. My other Mr. Coffee did not drip like this one when I would remove it to fill cup and replace it. Rather annoying, since it is supposed to Pause."
Rick,3.0,"March 17, 2015","Cannot make as strong coffee as pour-through drip like with cone on cup. Hot water doesn't soak in grounds long enough like it does with paper filter in cone.  Still, does a decent job for making brown-colored coffee.  It will make black-colored coffee IF you double the grounds you put in.  Better to pour finished coffee into your own insulated carafe instead of leaving on hot plate warmer."
songman999,5.0,"January 1, 2015",Coffeemaker stopped working after 8 months. Contacted Dr.Coffee and they sent a new one.The problem is the thermostat on the heating coil.Apparently this is well known.WE love this coffee maker and would buy it again as it keeps coffee HOT!
Jon,1.0,"March 16, 2016","it is 4:31 AM Mr Coffee not working, I have had this for just under three months, I guess I should have purchased a more expensive one, will cost more in time, effort and mailing costs."
Bill,2.0,"April 30, 2015","I purchased this on January 30, 2015 to replace one that wasn't all that old that started leaking for no reason.  Today is November 3rd 2015 and I have to throw this one out for the same exact reason.  I use it daily, so I got almost 9 full months out of it, but I won't be purchasing a Mr Coffee again."
Cindy Purdy,4.0,"January 13, 2014",Very stylish coffeemaker and looks brilliant on my granite countertops.  My only beef with this unit is the clock doesn't illuminate and the lettering is very small...you have to get really close to see everything.  Other than that...I'm still breaking it in and seems to work fine.  Would recommend to those with exceptional eye sight!!!  LOL!!.
D.H.P,5.0,"July 26, 2016","Awesome .. great coffee maker. Initial brew is Hot enough, but if you let it sit on the warming pad for a few minutes it does get and ad stay hot. Doesn't burn the coffee because the auto shut off works as intended. Very good coffee maker for the price"
Hanz  M.,1.0,"September 16, 2015","I don't know if there is something wrong with this coffeemaker or if I just got a defective unit. It has been sitting here ""brewing"" my morning pot of coffee for over an hour now. I will be returning this item."
Jeremy M. Rodriguez,1.0,"August 17, 2015","I bought this product as a gift for my parents and it broke within a week, leaking water all over their floor. The tubes inside disintegrated. Amazon quickly replaced with no hassle, then the new one broke after one use. The heating element did not work. They ended up going through the manufacturer to replace and the manufacturer did not even want to send the same model out due to so many problems. They ended up receiving a completely different model from Mr. Coffee."
Bonnie Bjork -Hiland,5.0,"December 17, 2013","Nice looking, makes good coffee and it is easy to fill with water!!!  Most coffee makers have this little place to fill it with water and you end up spilling all over and this one is so convenient!!  No more complaints from my husband about that!!Always have liked Mr Coffee makers and I haven't owned one for a few years and finally bought another one and I am glad I did."
Family of 4,4.0,"January 15, 2014","This coffee maker got awesome reviews online and consumer reports but i think it's only ok. It's very hard to clean the inside of it, where the water goes. There gets to be a build up and can't reach it unless you have skinny hands and toothbrush. We tried running vinegar through it and several other things. Makes coffee well though."
mom363546,5.0,"June 6, 2016","Been using this for awhile now, with no problems. I bought this on the damaged/used list for a discounted price, the item was in perfect condition. The only damage was to the box, otherwise the product was in mint condition with quick shipping1 Thanks"
free2bgr8ful,1.0,"March 29, 2017","I purchased this coffee maker about a year ago.  It stopped working last month and I needed to replace it.  I believe appliances should last a minimum of 5 years, and if they don't the company should pay an environmental land fill tax."
JLVH,4.0,"September 4, 2019",I bought this as a gift and it was ok.
Luis,5.0,"April 23, 2015",super fast shipping! this coffee maker is AMAZING at an INCREDIBLE price!!! got it for my wife because I broke her old one and we both love it! easy to use and it is beyond convenient for our work schedules. we leave everything ready before bed and wake up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee :)
Martin,2.0,"June 15, 2016","Don't waste your money on this one. At least twice a week, if not more this coffeemaker will end up overflowing through the top of the coffeemaker itself. Instead of dropping coffee into the carafe it just pours out and make a huge mess of grind and hot coffee."
Courtney Evelyn,5.0,"January 22, 2013","I love this thing. I've had it now for about three months, it still works perfect. Having no problems so far. Sometimes you just need, a simple coffee machine. A machine that makes coffee, and this comes with even a couple of settings. You press on, it'll brew. You want it less simple, then you can brew it ""strong"" or ""normal"". And then you can time when you want it to brew. I like this model, a lot of coffee pots break on me after a month, and they're crappy made. This is a WELL MADE coffee machine. I like it so much. ^.^"
Amazon Customer,5.0,"October 15, 2015",I just love it so much. Being able to program my coffee to be ready in the morning as I wake up is amazing. It is very easy to use and to clean. The quality of the coffee is perfect and I love the posibility to use a water filter as well. I would totally recommend this product.
Harry Joe,5.0,"July 13, 2016","I have been married a total of 47 years and have bought at least 25 coffee makers. I have had this one the longest yet, Consumer Reports recommends this one as first choice. I Love it. No problems now since I bought it Sept 2013 and going strong."
RAM,4.0,"October 29, 2013","if it doesnt brew at 190 degrees , forget it . one irritating feature is that the STRONG BREW light goes off . i used to have a hamilton beech that brewed at 190 degrees, carafe less, but they discontinued it. it was $30 more. i bot this a year ago, i think, and about 400+ brews and about 12 vinegar cleanings  later it still works well."
amasavah,5.0,"October 2, 2014","This coffee maker is perfect, when you really know how to make coffee only.I wish the basket would have an easier way to fit into the coffeemaker, every time I have to be checking the tabs on the basket so it's secured. Buy the water filter discs, I have been using it with other models and they do work in my coffee."
lsjerome,4.0,"May 4, 2017","Works well but seems slow and after a few months, it started beeping shortly after the start of the pot instead of the end of brewing.  Still seems like a great price and the delay brewing is awesome."
Jon Madden,4.0,"August 15, 2014","Best coffee maker I have used so far. Great timed brew function, and I like the quick-view water levels in the reservoir. The only improvement I can think is putting the reservoir window on the front of the machine instead of the side. Apart from that niggling detail, awesome coffee maker!!!"
K. McKeown,5.0,"September 6, 2015","I have not had any issue with this coffee maker. I have read the comments about smelling plastic - perhaps the company has made changes for this. When I received this, I immediately did the water/vinegar clean and enjoyed a great pot of coffee. I am very pleased with this purchase and it looks great on my counter as well."
NICOLE,5.0,"May 9, 2014","My mother recently wore out her old coffee pot and this was the upgrade. It is fantastic! Nice and big, beeps when the coffee is fully brewed, and has an easy to use brew timer. She couldn't be happier and highly recommends this. I will update my review when it finally burns out to give an idea of the life of the product."
O.M.G.,4.0,"December 16, 2014","Was working great until one day the water stopped coming out of the spout. Disassembled bottom panel and removed the two rubber tubes and cleaned these out. Then ran threw a brew cycle using white vinegar and it started working again.Machine is back to normal now, quality unit."
Linley,4.0,"January 17, 2014","I returned 2 of these because because of faulty operation--the ""strong"" brew didn't function, turning itself off after a few seconds. I'm now using a third one with no problems, and it brews very hot coffee as it should.  This the reason I wanted this model..the coffee flavor is much better.  Just wish it had a backlight clock display so I could see it better to program the delay brew feature."
Dawod Albattat,5.0,"May 4, 2015","I have been looking for a coffeemaker with a reasonable price and I found this one while browsing Amazon.This one is really worth it except that it only has a water filter while the permanent coffee filter is not included.Otherwise, it's all good but you need to order your coffee filter separately."
Ejmglo,1.0,"August 13, 2016","Defective product. After one year the unit ceased to heat or brew.Unforgiving service. I called the Customer Care number 1-800-672-6333. After troubleshooting the agent said that my unit was past one year warranty. Best can do is 10% discount off a new unit. Had I phoned a few days earlier, I would have been under the one-year window. Purchase date was August 9, 2015. Boo, Mr. Coffee. :-("
tme1315,5.0,"August 26, 2013","I love this coffee maker. It makes my coffee very hot, which is how I like my coffee. It has a choice of strong brew or regular. It even come with a filter for the water to make the coffee taste even better. I rated it 5 stars because I can't think of anything more I'd want this coffee maker to do. Very satisfied with this coffee maker."
tracy reads,1.0,"August 12, 2016","Purchased in October 2015, no longer heats or runs water through it in  August 2016. Household use, 1 pot a day. Lasted 10 months. It was cheap so the coffee wasn't great, but I think a product, with normal usage, should last at least a year."
J.H.N.,5.0,"November 15, 2014","The product came in two days as expected for Prime's customer and is brand new as advertised. It is very easy to setup, just follow the instruction that comes with the package and you will be enjoying a fresh cup of coffee in a chilly Fall morning. Thank you amazon.com for striving to keep your customers satisifed. Keep up the good work."
MIKE,3.0,"February 28, 2018","Works fine, BUT the paint comes off the heating element leading to RUST. Too bad the manufacturer can't figure OR AFFORD to use STAINLESS STEEL!"
Stephanie,1.0,"April 9, 2015","Poorly made. It worked for a week and then the clock wouldn't set, therefore I couldn't set my coffee to brew in the morning. A month later the coffee would only brew in regular mode and beeped after 20 seconds instead of when the coffee was done brewing. Not worth the money."
R. Roll,4.0,"March 18, 2014","I really love this coffee maker.  It looks great, works great and makes great coffee.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that I had to return the first one that I received because the LED readout wasn't working properly and I could not read the time as the numbers were all broken up.  The new one works just fine."
Donna F. Artis,5.0,"May 27, 2013","This coffeemaker is really great for the price.  The coffee is as tasty as the coffee I used to make in a much more expensive coffeemaker.  I purchased the permanent filter which is okay, but I probably wouldn't order another.  It's difficult to clean so I'llprobably go to paper filters at some point.  If you want good coffee for a reasonable price this is great."
Irene McLaughlin,5.0,"June 5, 2014",Nice looking coffee pot .I  don't bother with the automatic setting so can't say  how well it works. I like that it turns off automatically. Only problem I had was when I neglected to properly seat the basket and got a lot of grounds in the coffee. Won't do that again.
Penny Sumner,2.0,"May 26, 2016","First of all I was sent a espresso maker, then when I sent that back I finally got the 12 cup coffee maker.  It didn't last very long  (even with cleaning ) myhard water clogged it.  I will say it has the best pouring coffee carafe that I've ever had!"
bigboppar,5.0,"March 28, 2015","I purchased this at an incredible value of $19.  It is a wonderful machine--in terms of concept, practicality, beauty, and function.  The regular/strong brew feature really does make a difference, and is a great option.  And folks, most importantly, it makes a HOT, TERRIFIC cup of coffee."
DanCooperMedia,4.0,"September 20, 2013",All the features work well. I would single out the fact that you can watch the amount of water you're putting in by looking at the outside window which is marked in cups. One quibble is that the glass carafe is rounded and narrows toward the top rather than being squared off which seems to me makes it more difficult to clean.
H. Engineer,5.0,"July 11, 2015","Purchased this coffee maker in December 2013, and have used it daily. Visited Amazon today thinking to purchase an upgraded model and found this one is still the #1 rated. Decided to stick with my current Mr. Coffee for as long a it will last!"
NW,1.0,"March 30, 2014","Things seemed ok for a few weeks, then noticed that my coffee tasted weird.  Washed out my coffee maker, changed my coffee brand, still the same, odd taste.  After working through my paranoia ( OMG, I have a disease where I'm losing my sense of taste, I'm going to die), I reverted back to common sense.  Searched both Amazon reviews and other and what do you know...I""VE BEEN DRINKING MELTED PLASTIC!!! Are you kidding me??? Does a new kidney come with the refund? What a piece of garbage...also, shame on consumerreports for rating this health threat as a recommended buy."
Sue M,5.0,"July 9, 2013","I was strictly a percolator person before trying this Mr. Coffee coffeemaker.  Makes great, hot coffee.  I purchased the stainless steel Thermal Carafe also.  The coffeemaker can tell which caraffe is being used and will only activate the heating plate when the glass carafe is being used for brewing.  Good idea - no fussing with settings or controls when using different carafe.  Mr. Coffee takes care of it for you!"
Ramie A Poe,1.0,"August 27, 2015","Makes great coffee, and we found that it only needed half the coffee grounds of our old Mr. Coffee. 10/19/2015 update. It has already stopped working! The lights come on, but nothing happens! You'd think it would last more than 3 months."
TheOldOne,4.0,"July 18, 2016","I am still learning the bells and whistles with this brewer, but so far I am quite pleased with the results.  The only minus is that it seems to take quite awhile to brew just two cups.  Other than that, I am quite  pleased with it."
RTyler,5.0,"December 18, 2013","Bought this coffee maker a week ago.  It brews wonderful coffee and looks great on the counter.  To my surprise, the price went down 2-days after I received it.  Contacted customer service and viola, they credited me the difference on the spot.  If you aren't already, become a PRIME MEMBER!!!  You won't regret the PERKS!!!"
Amazon Customer,5.0,"September 16, 2012","I had a basic Mr. Coffee but found my coffee was not as hot as I wanted after sitting in a thermos travel mug for an hour. So I went shopping for hotter coffee. Higher priced models - $100+ -  offer that but in reading the reviews, I saw this maker also was listed as hotter. It is, and its perfect for me. In addition, it lets you increase the brew strength. That turns out to be a great feature as well."
G. Muenster,5.0,"January 5, 2013","Got this for my mother. The last one I got her was ""too modern"" so she didn't like it. So she asked for a Mr. Coffee. I picked out a couple and read the information to her over the phone and she picked this one. She says it makes great coffee, she see how much she has too. Did not get the metal caraff, it came with the glass one."
Randy,2.0,"February 15, 2016","Worked fine until this morning.  The thing lights up but that's all...no heating, no nothing.  The biggest complaint is that the coffee maker is only 6 months old.  It should last longer than that as I only use it twice a day."
Gloria West,5.0,"October 12, 2013","This coffeemaker deserves 10 stars!  Since it brews very hot, it brings out the rich flavor of the coffee.  Consumer Reports rated this Mr. Coffeemaker tops and since they did the research we knew their recommendation would bring us a great cup of coffee.  The drip-free carafe is a wonderful improvement.  What a great price!"
Dr. A,5.0,"October 10, 2015","Have been using Mr Coffee  brewer for the past 20 years,  I love it and found it superier to other more expensive coffee makers  which I have tried in  the past I always  return  to Mr.Coffee  for  my ""best""cup of coffee"
Frederick A. Schrader,5.0,"July 4, 2014",This is my second identical Mr Coffee programmable coffeemaker.  My first one was fine but sometimes dripped if pouring a cup of coffee before the brewing was complete.  This one doesn't drip at all.  The Coffeemaker makes an excellent cup of coffee and the design makes a very worthy addition to the kitchen counter.
patpita,4.0,"October 31, 2014","I've had the coffee pot for about a month, and like it very much. Good tasting coffee and good looking unit.A short coming however is the difficulty of replacing the filter. I found one at Target that included the filter (1) and the ring that holds it $4.99. All that is needed is the filter."
Cheryl M,1.0,"July 8, 2016",This is the worst coffee pot ever. I am on my 3rd one. it last all of 7 to 8 months and then breaks. First you experience coffee spilling everywhere and then the water will not filter to the coffee grinds. I use filtered water when filling.
DawnaH,4.0,"December 4, 2014","It's an inexpensive and decent coffee maker, what more do you need to say about it? other than it beeps when done, which at 5am is a little annoying, but otherwise is a handy feature - Would recommend.  There is a strong plastic smell  for the first week, but it dissipates and is no longer a problem."
SG,4.0,"January 31, 2016","Surprisingly pleased with this coffeemaker.  Our 10 year old delonghi thermal carafe began leaking and I could not find a replacement.  The delonghi had an ""aroma"" brew cycle meant to brew stronger and the thermal carafe kept our coffee hot for literally hours.  I was skeptical about the mr coffee but also cannot afford a $100 machine. I purchased the 12 cup programmable and the thermal carafe.  I despise glass carafes. Unfortunately I was not careful reading the description and the thermal carafe is only 8 cups, hub and I go through at least 10 cups each morning.  Anyway turns out the thermal carafe is unnecessary. The strong brew setting on this unit gives us a very decent cup (Costco coffee - that stuff is delish!) and the coffee is HOT for two hours without the burnt flavor I have experienced with glass carafes in the past.  We are experiencing a minor issue with grounds in the pot but I believe hubs is sloppy with filling the basket. He adamently denies that allegation.  The programmable feature and auto-shut-off are terrifically handy.  The bold coffee taste and hot temp are the main selling points for me.  I'm going to order one for my parents so that hubs and I have a decent cup when visiting."
Cathy L.,2.0,"December 13, 2014","This is an update to my review.  Initially we loved this coffee maker.  It is now 8 months later and it takes almost an hour to brew 12 cups of coffee.  I'm not sure what's going on, but you start with putting 12 cups of water in and end up with 10 cups of coffee by the time it's done brewing.  Not happy at all anymore.  Well, one thing still makes me happy about this coffee pot.  It still doesn't dribble when you pour."
SKLee,2.0,"May 11, 2016","Purchased in July 2015 and it just stopped working after eight months. The display, etc. still works but it's just stopped making coffee, so I guess you get who's you pay for. The coffee quality was Peery good if a bit weak. Even the ""strong"" setting made just an average cup of coffee. Not sure I'm impressed with the Mr. Coffee brand."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"September 22, 2016",This coffee maker never really worked very well.  I think there was a wiring problem of some kind and it would get way too hot.  Trashed it after less than a month of use.  Replaced it with a boring old Mr. Coffee ($20) that is working more than a year later.
GeeDee,5.0,"August 25, 2013","I bought this after researching coffee makers.  I didn't want to spend a lot, and this maker got good reviews in Consumers Reports.  It makes a pot of coffee in 12 minutes, and the temperature seems to be just right.  It replaced an earlier version, also by Mr. Coffee, and seems to be a little better.  I am very pleased."
Amazon Customer,5.0,"December 30, 2012","Had this unit two years and it has worked every single day. Easy to clean, easy to fill. I usually only want eight cups at a time, but I've found when making 12 cups it sometimes over flows the basket and makes a mess. Especially like the metal screen filter and the ""strong"" setting button on the front. Makes great coffee."
Mathew Sims,5.0,"March 13, 2015",I have enjoyed making coffee with the Mr. Coffee. The temp has been consistent with every cup. The controls were simple after one read of instructions. I love being able to control the brew strength and also set a delayed brew. The best coffee brewer for the price you will find.
DaveA,4.0,"January 1, 2013",It makes good coffee and is easy to use. It uses less coffee (even at regular strength setting) than my previous coffeemaker to achieve the same strength. Programmability is very easy to use. My only complaint is that the inside of the coffeemaker is left dripping with condensed water at the end of brewing and will not dry out between daily uses unless all of the nooks and crannies are laboriously wiped dry.
Jana Mutie,4.0,"October 16, 2014",Actually does a decent job of brewing for the price!  Wish the control panel and clock were lighted. Best to drink your coffee freshly brewed if using the glass carafe; coffee tends to develop an off taste if left on the warmer for any length of time. Consider purchasing the stainless steel thermal pot if you are fussy about you coffee like I am.
CPR,1.0,"May 5, 2015",Nice features include being able to adjust brew strength to strong. Looks gd. . Good price.Problems: I bought 2. 1 has gone defunct and won't heat anymore in <1yr. The other started malfunctioning in 5months and making a mess all over the counter. Don't buy these
Lucyland,5.0,"May 3, 2016","Per the subject line, this is a true story. We purchased our Mr. Coffee last August after our second Cuisinart brewer decided to stop working. For the first month I hated the strong scent of ""manufacturing"" that lingered, but once it faded away I would try to convince myself to take the time to write a positive review on a regular basis. Because as it happens Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT makes a fine cup of joe indeed.Last night was no different--as I prepared the delayed brew for this morning once again the ""you should really write a positive review of this coffee maker"" mantra struck again. But of course reading Quora and watching Empire took priority...And then the unfathomable happened: my husband informed me our normally-programmed coffee did not brew! Despite functioning lights and proper time on the clock, there was a 0% chance Mr. Coffee was going to work again. (AeroPress to the rescue!)After spending time with both Amazon and Mr. Coffee customer support (thank you, ladies!) our coffee machine was deemed an anomaly, our warranty confirmed valid, and a replacement is on it's way. So, while the machine stopped working, both Amazon and Mr. Coffee's customer support came through for us which is worth mentioning."
PC guy,3.0,"May 15, 2017",Bought this to replace the exact same model that my daughter bought me as a gift 3 years ago so I am very familiar with this model. My old one still worked but was showing signs of age. I tossed it and wish I hadn't. The coffee tastes terrible on this model if you use the timer. The heater that keeps the coffee hot is so hot that it scalds the coffee making it taste terrible. The taste isn't bad if you drink the coffee right after brewing but not as good as my old one:(
Scottie Dobson,2.0,"December 6, 2015","First month coffee taste like plastic. Worked for six months and then just stopped brewing coffee. Hard to clean, lots of residual water sitting around inside the base. Kind of a cheap piece of garbage made to ""look"" nice."
Ollie,1.0,"October 23, 2016",It's terrible! Even the strong setting doesn't make bold coffee. I have to use 30% more coffee to get a half way decent cup of coffee. I just started using it and my time is up for returning it. I'm so bummed!
centralOR,2.0,"February 9, 2014","This coffemaker is large, not so much in capacity but in design.  I did not keep it because it was too big for the space I had for it.  It may make wonderful coffee, I don't know.  Be aware of its measurements before you order it.  It appears much larger because of its square design than you would think."
nansi35,1.0,"November 24, 2016",I bought this in October 2015 and had to replace it in March 2016. I was hoping it was just a fluke....  I was wrong.  Today my second one broke.  I believe both times the pump stopped working.  Very disappointed!
TenesmusD,5.0,"January 30, 2014","Nice little coffee maker. Easy to program. Makes a good pot of coffee, and does it fairly quickly.The water filter is a little silly. They expect you to add an additional plastic bracket with the water filter on it before you make coffee... not gonna happen. We just use tap water and it's excellent."
MJT & JLY,5.0,"August 6, 2014","Love this coffee pot - great features and can't beat the price! Got it to replace same model we inadvertently left full of coffee that molded :/ the shut off feature is nice, as well as alarm that sounds when coffee is ready. Love that you can select type of carafe as well as brew strength."
Nina Z.,1.0,"February 12, 2016","JUNK. The only way to describe this thing! After the first use, the steam warped the lid and now the lid won't close properly. I was better off with my 10yr old Cuisinart that worked just fine. Will never go with a Mr. Coffee again!"
greg,5.0,"September 9, 2015","One of the best ever products I've ever purchased.  Finally, the perfect cup of coffee every time.  Just be sure that the filter basket is correctly seated in the machine, i.e. it's in it's proper position.  Other than that, I'm taking this one to my grave."
JA,5.0,"March 13, 2015",So far the coffee maker has performed as expected.  I have not yet found a reasonably priced local source for the replacement MR COFFEE branded water filters for this machine however there do appear to be generic filters available.  The maker does make a good coffee quickly
Russ,4.0,"June 24, 2012","This is a beautiful coffeemaker!!  I like how the top opens and the filter sits in a removable bowl.  The brewing options are nice, too.  Highly recommend this one.After using this product for quite awhile, I still like it.  The only thing I would complain about is the pour.  If we try to pour too fast, it drips down the outside of the pot and pools on the counter.  The Cuisinart brand has a feature where the lid that actually pops into the pot and has little ""dams"" on each side of the spout so this does not happen."
Marzen,4.0,"September 21, 2014","Only thing worth noting that I did not read elsewhere is that it Beeps Loudly when the brewing is completed, and again when it shuts off the hot plate after 2 hours.  Other than that it seems like a good design, looks like it's more expensive than it is, and works great after a week of use."
Nonotuck Community School,1.0,"May 11, 2015","Purchased in Dec 2013 this coffee maker 'died' in May 2015. It was used 5 days a week, at most, usually for only one pot a day.  Why would it break after so short a time?We liked it well enough while we had it, but this is very disappointing.  Will not buy again"
Ron M,5.0,"March 30, 2014","Our expensive Cuisinart that broke after just 1 year.  We decided that we didn't need an expensive replacement and thought we would go back to a regular Mr. Coffee. We are very pleased that the coffee, features and ease of clean up made this a perfect purchase and at 1/3 the cost of our Cuisinart."
Dr. Jason Piccolo,1.0,"March 23, 2018","Regular use (1/2 a pot day) and it died at 1 1/4 years.  I know, it's not a ""premium"" machine but it should last at least a couple years or more."
Kindle Customer,3.0,"September 21, 2016","I have been getting Mr. Coffee's for a few years now. I have had several, as they are cheap, and therefore, easily replaceable. I do not expect them to last long. This particular one is extremely slow. The filter is a waste of time. I did get the filter holder included, along with one filter. I made a mistake and ordered a package of five additional filters. They only filter out chlorine. I use a Pur Water Pitcher that filters out more particulate matter than that. I will use these filters and then not buy any more. This particular Mr. Coffee has one great improvement: When you close the top, if you have not re-positioned the water spout where it is supposed to be, the top pushes it over the coffee basket.Other than that, I really like my older and plainer Mr. Coffee 12 cup programmable coffee makers better! This one is taller, and as I am short, it is harder to get the pitcher up high enough to pour the water into the container. It is bulkier and takes up more room. Also the top opens from side to side, meaning that I am constantly moving the pot away from the wall to its right in order to pour in the water. I saw the old model at Publix for about $8 cheaper, but I will use this one until it stops working."
James J. Stark,4.0,"May 3, 2014","Comes without paper filters or a gold leaf filter, but paper filters are easily acquired.  I don't like glass carafes because the heater plate burns the coffee, but you can buy a thermal carafe from the manufacturer that disables the heater plate.  All told, inexpensive and decent coffee maker."
sadie,4.0,"September 18, 2014","I like this coffee pot,coffee is hot. Some said plastic smell yes there is a smell like all plastic when first opened but went away after washing and coffee is great some can find problem with everything. NO PLASTIC TASTE WITH MY COFFEE MAKER"
Dennis Hull,1.0,"October 29, 2016",Pause & serve feature is flawed in that the it doesn't allow liquid to pass through fast causing overflow from the top and coffee grounds all over.Removal of the pause & serve valve moves liquid through too quickly resulting in weak coffee.Just poorly engineered ot at least one defective unit.I'm off to Target for a new machine.
Emrozz,2.0,"January 7, 2014","The controls on this coffee maker went bad after 1 year.  Steam from the pot wafts up the front and damages the control board behind the plastics.  Thats no good!!  Returned it, got a new one and the same thing happened.  Black and Decker makes a nice coffee machine for about $20 that doesn't do this."
Partman,4.0,"July 15, 2016",Still working fine as of 7/15/16 - months later.  Only issue is that the design requires the top lid to be open to add the water.  my last mr. coffee had a poor thru grate.  it probably cost a few pennies more though
Shawn Moon,1.0,"May 13, 2019",Thankfully I was in my return window. Couldn't believe this broke in 3 weeks - just plain old didn't work after a few weeks
Mary W. Smith,2.0,"January 24, 2017","This started out well, doing everything it's supposed to...but just over a year later, it has suddenly stopped working!!!!!!!!!!  This is a terrible performance for a coffee maker!!!!!!!!!!!"
Daveswife,3.0,"January 3, 2015","This coffee pot is O.K., but I actually prefer a Bun. I was going to switch so I purchased this, but after receiving it, and looking it over I decided to stick with my Bun. I'm not saying this is a bad pot, but I need my coffee fast in the morning. I didn't send the pot back because like I said there is nothing wrong with it. Just not for me, so I gave it as a gift to somebody that can wait in the AM and needed a coffeepot. I asked how the pot was working out for my freind, and he has had no problems with it at all. So I will recommend this pot if you are a Mister Coffee person!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Reluctant Amazon User,5.0,"June 29, 2016","A life saver: coffee in the morning.  Controls are a little tiny but are spaced out well, so really once you use your glasses and know what button does what it's pretty automatic.  After all there are only a few choices.  If it ever burns out I'll buy this again."
Joshua Rose,3.0,"August 8, 2016",It came in a good sized box very well packaged ! The plastic is a little cheap but the thing works great every time ! It has a beeper witch is nice when your coffee is done brewing ! Stays hot for a long time .
Brent,5.0,"November 26, 2015","Bought this coffee maker for my parents since they've gone through about three of them this year. Works well so far and is well built. Definitely makes a good cup of coffee. However, if this doesn't last at least a year I'll be changing this review."
Glenn,2.0,"October 6, 2012","When we first got it, it was great.  However, the carafe spilled when you poured it.  Other than that it was great, until it stopped working after a year.  About two weeks after the warranty expired, it quick working and we had to replace it.  Very aggravating, we replaced it with a more expensive model from another company."
G. C. Anderson,2.0,"December 6, 2011","This coffee maker worked well for about 3 weeks. Suddenly,using the same coffee and same type paper filter,the water would not spray into the ground coffee.What we got was steam and some damp coffee grounds.Needless to say but I was a bit irritated.WE tried running a pot of plain water through it with the same result,steam but no water flow.This coffee maker is a Consumer Report selection and this was part of the reason I purchased it.As luck would have it there is a Mr.Coffee Service Center in MA.so for just under $9.00 I was able to ship it there for what the service rep said would be repair or replacement.Now waiting to seee what it will be."
Heidi,1.0,"June 25, 2015","I went through two of these coffeemakers.  They both stopped working a few months after using them.  I decided to splurge since we're huge coffee drinkers and got a BUNN instead.  In my opinion, this coffeemaker is terrible."
Frank The Tank,3.0,"June 26, 2016","The unit failed today (won't brew), just out of warranty; no service centers in NC.  Its not the valve; I checked it and it was clean; see directions here [...].It's a $30 coffee maker.  Worked fine otherwise"
Michael B. Wilkins Sr.,5.0,"January 19, 2014","I studied a lot of coffee makers before I bought this one from Amazon, read some of the reviews which stated it had a bad smell during the brewing cycle. Not to sure who made that comment, but they are nuts. I have owned Keurig, Gefalia coffee makers and they don't match the quality of the MR Coffee BVMC-3JX33GT."
Bridget H.,5.0,"October 26, 2016","Very nice coffee maker and I love the audible that it is shutting off so I know I have to go turn it back on if I did not drink all my coffee.  Looks nice on the kitchen counter too, which is always a plus."
MEL D,4.0,"January 6, 2020",great coffee machine but the shipment was too longI found it a couple dollars less expensive at Walmart
flpalmtree,3.0,"May 17, 2014","Pros:* Makes good coffee.Cons:* Due to an amazing amount of condensation, takes 16 ounces of water to make a 12 ounce cup of coffee.* Cupcake filters -- this is my first cupcake filter machine, all my prior coffeemakers used cone filters; my experience with this machine is that the cupcake filters fall over while brewing much more often than cone filters, which causes grounds to end up in the coffee."
Mitch K,4.0,"August 5, 2016",Before this coffee maker my wife just growled at me every morning. Now she only growls till halfway through her first cup. Makes the mornings much more enjoyable.
Stephen N.,1.0,"December 11, 2015","I bought this in June. By December, it stopped brewing coffee. Even trying to clean it with white vinegar didn't work. I'm tossing it in the trash. So much for Mr. NoCoffee."
Olivia,5.0,"May 21, 2016",This Mr. Coffee machine came on time and in good shape.  I had bought a similar machine a few years ago.  It died due to a power surge.  So far this one is doing great.  wish it came in more varied colors.  Thank you
Miguel,3.0,"May 9, 2014","The coffee maker does what it is supposed to do without too much trouble, but you can tell it was made to last just a few years at most. The clock is already broken, sadly. If you need something to make coffee and don't want to pay that much, go ahead and buy it; if you want a durable coffee maker, spend a little more of something else."
Kristina K,5.0,"March 14, 2015",I just received my item and have used it several times already. It is easy to set up and looks so good!! I love the blue and green light that comes on when it's brewing and when you set a delay brew. Happy so far with my purchase. Great price compared to others.
Amazon Customer,5.0,"December 30, 2011","After disappointing results with other coffee makers, including other Mr. Coffee models, I am totally satisfied with this one. I can't think of one negative!I love that it will accept a thermal carafe (optional accessory) as well as the standard glass carafe. It detects which carafe is being used, so it can automatically disable the hot plate when the thermal carafe is in use."
Billy,2.0,"July 24, 2015","Great coffee maker for the price.  Overall, I would buy this again and recommend it to others.UPDATE: 4-19-2017I bought this in July 2015 by November of 2015 it stoped working. I contacted them and they sent me another coffee maker. Well, today the replcement has stopped working. Their customer service was on it the first time and I really like the coffee maker which is why they get 2 stars. However, 2 coffee makers within 1 year and 9 months is not very good. There are some quality issues that need to be addressed if your products barely lasts 1 year."
Richard Mortenson,4.0,"January 28, 2015",It is a very good coffee maker.  The best feature is that it keeps the finished coffee very hot.  A problem area is in the filling of water where there is a gap between the water tank and filter holder which can cause water to seep onto the heating pad if one is not careful while filling the tank.
Laurie K,3.0,"April 11, 2013","The top of the unit has a lid and the water needs to be poured into the back, where it is very easy to pour into the coffee area.  Even though I had the coffee container in the unit correctly it occasionally jams holding water in the coffee area and spilling grounds down into the pot.  Not the best design."
Rochelle,4.0,"January 28, 2014","Wow Mr. Coffee has been around long time I figure they know about coffee makers. I have spent lots of money on coffee makers ,I haven't had a Mr. Coffee maker in a long time, but for the price I decided to buy one. I really like it . Works great have hot coffee on time every morning. You really cant go wrong with this maker."
bill.k,4.0,"April 11, 2013","After reading many reviews, I was worried about a plastic smell or taste. My husband ran a pot of regualr water through it once, then made us some very delicious coffee. So far, it is a great coffee pot for the price :)UPDATE: July 18 2013, this pot is still going strong and making wonderful coffee :)"
maggie,4.0,"December 11, 2013",I just got it yesterday. Nice looking Nice price. Nicely packed so it wouldn't move or break. I probably won't use the water filter. It won't change the taste that much and is just something else to bother with and buy every month. I know Mr. Coffee makes good coffee. that is why I bought it.
Liz,4.0,"May 21, 2013","This is our first coffeepot purchase.  After reading some of the reviews, I was a little leary, but bought it anyway.  We haven't had any issues with it at all.  I don't have problems reading the display like some have.  I love that it's programmable and is easy to use.  The only drawback of it is that I actually have to move it from underneath the overhead cabinets to open the top and put in the coffee grinds and water because the unit is fairly tall and the lid goes across the entire top."
lealel1977,4.0,"December 28, 2014",Love this coffeemaker...great price too.  Only complaint is the auto shutoff.  I drink coffee for hours and wish the warmer would stay on longer than two hours.  Have looked online to see if I can remedy this to no avail.  Still happy with this coffeemaker though.
SueS.,5.0,"May 20, 2013",This coffe maker is wonderful. It is so easy to use and was very easy to set up. It is sleek and looks good on the kitchen counter.  I read several reviews that said when they first got the coffee maker it had a bad smell. I did not experience that at all. I would highly recommend this coffee maker.
Pat D,4.0,"August 28, 2016",Bought 1st Sept 2012 ... work fine. Just started leaking from the base on  out 24rd August......a week shy of 4 years. Not shabby based on how quickly some other coffee makers have stopped working correctly . At 5 years I would have given it 5 stars.
mfme,2.0,"May 22, 2015","It's a coffee machine, it makes coffee. The only problem I have with is it never shuts off, even when you plug it in without turning any of the button/switches on the element heats up, I ended up burning my fingers this morning. I think it could be defective. Once again while trying to save money, I've learned that cheap is expensive."
Reviewer2013,4.0,"May 5, 2015","This coffee pot works well.  My only issue is that on 3 occasions, we had coffee miss the caraffe and land on the hot plate or floor.  It seems that the caraffe is fitting correctly but I have not been able to figure out how the coffee is getting out."
rt lover,4.0,"March 17, 2012","This coffee maker fits well on the counter, fills relatively easily, glides smoothly on the counter when full, and most importantly makes a great cup of coffee.  The delay switch is convenient and there is even a button to select regular or strong brew.  The only problem I find with this coffee maker is that the carafe has a tendency to drip when full and is more difficult to clean than most others I have owned.  A bottle brush makes the task easier."
M L White,1.0,"February 8, 2018",I have it one star for the looks.  I wished I read the comments about the plastic..... Mine is just about 2 years and still has the plastic smell and taste.
Amazon Customer,2.0,"July 8, 2015",It was great... been a few months and now the coffee pot brews constantly. I came home from work one day and it was on. The timer wasn't set or anything... Just possessed. It comes on all the time. I have to leave it unplugged
Sugarlover,5.0,"August 14, 2013",Thank you SO MUCH for processing my order so quickly and shipping it SO FAST! Love the coffee pot. Doesn't drip when you fill it with water and is VERY easy to use. Also like that it has the brewing option to make the coffee stronger. Great purchase...SUPER happy with all aspects of this transaction!
peter Brown,3.0,"June 29, 2013",Bought this unit based on recommendations.  Found it does a decent job making coffee and generally meets expectations but does nothing really special.  Kind of a pain dealing with water nozzle that has to be moved every time coffee is added.  Also don't appreciate condensation that collects all over inside of the top and drizzles down into the water reservoir (and sometimes onto the counter) when the top is opened.
V. Qberry,1.0,"May 1, 2016","I purchased this item used and it looked wonderful but, just stopped working after one month. I didn't want to return the itemfor another used product so I just bought a new one."
D. Tholen,5.0,"June 22, 2013","I debated over this for a long time.  Different models, sizes, styles, brands and prices.  This fit all the afore mentioned things perfect.  The pot looks great.  Has a timer to wake up to hot coffee, shuts itself off after 2 hrs....now if only they figure out a way to get it to empty the filter!"
L. Willis,4.0,"December 26, 2013","Received this coffee pot a couple of weeks ago and we've been happy with it. It took a few attempts to get the timer figured out for the delayed brewing, but once we got it straight, no other problems.  The coffee brews up fast and tastes great.  For the money, a really good purchase!"
kaseyd50,4.0,"June 15, 2013","It makes a decent cup of coffee.  Some of the designs of the maker I do not care for.  For example the way the coffee basket goes into the machine, a bit odd and I needed to get use to it.  I do like the option of wanting my coffee stronger or not thought.  All in all and OK product for the money"
Wskegrl,2.0,"April 4, 2016","I don't care for the pour spout on the decanter.  Also, pouring into the coffee maker into the back corner isn't ideal.  The digital display doesn't have a back light.  Disappointed all around."
Worcester MA,1.0,"December 24, 2015","UPDATE-After just a little over 90 days (of course after the return policy is no longer valid), this coffee maker does not drain fast enough and you end up with a pot of grounds.  YUCK!"
L. Milo,5.0,"March 20, 2017",Wanted a simple coffee maker. I dont drink coffee everyday and i am the only one in my house who drinks it so this was perfect. It works great. No problems at all.
Steve,1.0,"June 12, 2016",I've had it for 7 months and the thermal fuse already failed. I only use it twice a week. Apparently this is a common issue with this brand.  I will look for something better for my next purchase.
Mogul42,5.0,"January 19, 2020",Given away as a gift.  They like it.
Scott Carter,2.0,"December 28, 2016",After 1 year the coffee maker failed and would no longer turn on.  I performed the normal cleaning and it was used every day.  Disappointed it only worked for such a short time.
Eileen,1.0,"November 24, 2014",I have always had Mr Coffee and never had a problem but this one is different .  For some reason unless you pay special attention to the position of the pot and water spout it leaks all over the place and creates a mess. Also time display does not light and is difficult to see.
kathy,5.0,"March 21, 2014","This is the best coffee-maker I've ever owned--& I have had many!!  It makes a very good, hot cup of coffee, it is easy to clean, & it offers  an optional insulated carafe to have on hand for company.  I couldn't find the extra carafe on Amazon, so I called 'Mr. Coffee' & they couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating!  (Unlike Cuisinart, whose products I will never use again--their customer service is terrible!)  And it was only $40!"
Lexie,1.0,"October 21, 2013","The best part of waking up isn't the device beeping at us.  I am not sure if this device wanted to be an alarm clock but didn't get to fulfill its dream but it beeps, loudly, when it starts to brew.  No good reason and I cannot find a way to disable it.  Miserable.Also, if you spill ANY coffee into the basket holder it will plug up and drain coffee all over the counter."
Johns Tablet,5.0,"November 18, 2017","priced right and has a two year warranty with it, after two years just buy another one for the 20.00 price, a good product"
Rick E.,3.0,"November 7, 2015",It makes good coffee and has some nice features. The only con is that it takes 20 minutes to brew a pot of coffee. It's not a major spoiler if you just set your brew start time accordingly.
Wilburto,2.0,"January 4, 2017",it lasted less than 2 years.wouldn't buy again.get a cheap one with a switch for alot less and lasts longer without programming.
janie,1.0,"October 27, 2016","I'm sorry but this didn't meet my expectations, there was no electricity, meaning when plugged in the cord did not produce a electrical power. But things happen, I was able to return it."
swks,3.0,"April 8, 2017","This quit after 15 months, and I used it only twice a week.  Guessing the heating element went out.  I will say it made good coffee, but i won't buy another."
"P, M. Buchanan",5.0,"August 18, 2014",I was buying coffee makers that cost at least twice as much and they always had faults and did not last very long.  I just threw out the Wolfgang Puck that worked ok for a while.  This Mr. Coffee was a very pleasant surprise.  I just hope it lasts a little while.
Patrick Pecoraro,1.0,"March 23, 2019",Both coffee makers that I purchased had the same issue would not brew until the pause and serve feature was removed I would not recommend this particular model to anyone
edanc,4.0,"July 9, 2014","A DIFFICULT PURCHASE after seeing all the ""1"" reviews but glad I made the purchase irrespective of them --  I have used it for 2-3 months now.  IT IS HOT as I dare sip. Bad taste is definitely not a problem. And the ease of filling -- well, if you can design one better, you are indeed talented."
Bryce,4.0,"January 3, 2015",Works okay but leaves water inside the lid more than my old Mr. Coffee.  But it is easier to keep clean even though I don't use the water filter over the grounds.  I also got the reusable filter basket which makes better coffee than the paper filters.
Chris,1.0,"November 22, 2015","After 87 days the heating element burned out.  Cheap is an appropriate description.  I just bought a Bunn to replace it.  So long Mr Coffee, I will not be purchasing your products again.."
D. Johnson,3.0,"October 12, 2014",Works well.  Thought the metal canister would keep coffee hot longer and didn't realize the heater is in the base where you sit the coffee pot...which heats up the metal canister.  Like my previous one (which was a Mr. Coffee) better but am using this one.
Andy D,3.0,"July 31, 2018",Worked great but after 3 years it started leaking and I had to throw it away.
Rob+LC,3.0,"November 1, 2015","We have a kurig coffee machine, but we wanted something for the weekends when we wanted more than just one cup of coffee. 3 stars because when pouring the water in it sometimes leaks out"
Sheila Hynes,4.0,"August 3, 2016","My only complaint is the mechanism that puts the water into the grounds is sort of strange. There's an arm that you have to swing out over it, and if you forget to, it can lead to a mess."
Joe Hawk,1.0,"June 17, 2016","Worked OK for first few months, but stopped brewing after 4 months. Turns on but won't start brewing. Followed troubleshooting instructions with no avail. Tried descaling too. Quality of this coffee make is lacking to kick the bucket after only 4 months of daily use."
purple_monkey_dishwasher,1.0,"December 23, 2015",Worked great until it stopped working today.  Seems like the heating element burned out or something.  Lasted about 6 months which seems consistent with some of the other reviews I've seen on here.  Definitely won't be buying this brand again.
Paula,5.0,"August 2, 2015","We own two.  We bought one for in our motorhome because it's compact and the cord hides away inside it.  It turns out it makes good coffee too, so we bought a second one for our house and got rid of the giant coffee maker we had before!  Hooray for more counter space!"
DPR,4.0,"June 27, 2013","Makes Coffee, Programmable in advance, basic without all the extra do-dads you don't need. Nice chrome look. Sometimes grounds are in coffee pot after brewing, haven't figured out why, as am very careful with loading basket. A minor annoyance, otherwise worth buying."
Tag68,5.0,"February 11, 2014","I just got this, read the instructions because it looked complicated and found it wasn't, made my first pot of coffee because that is a must in the mornings to get me heart started pumping again, and it was DELICIOUS!  This is an excellent coffeepot - I am impressed!!!"
Délé,2.0,"February 20, 2014","I'm no coffee connoisseur, but I think this machine makes a decent pot of coffee. The reason for the low rating is because the clock is quirky and the delay brew doesn't work. Occasionally the clock will keep time, but more often it runs about 5 minutes fast every 24 hours. I didn't expect this to be a high quality machine, but I do expect products to work as advertised."
CJINTIPP,1.0,"May 22, 2016","Started to fail after 3 weeks, but we thought it was just an on/off switch issue. After 3 months of ownership it continues to shut off after 2-3 minutes. Too late for exchange, so buyer beware."
Gr8OKcooks,5.0,"July 16, 2016",Have had for months and am very pleased. Just enough special features. Recommend the mr. coffee slightly deeper filters though. The coffee grounds overflowed when using regular filters.
Fred,4.0,"September 24, 2014",The coffeemaker works well.  Some folk muttered about an off taste initially but that did not happen with this maker.  Easy to program for delayed start.  I like the cone filters better than the cupcake filters but life goes on.
Stylinhairguy,5.0,"March 7, 2017","Works perfectly, looks nice in my apartment. Top of the actual coffee pot itself is kind of cheap and flimsy, but it does what it needs to do. Programmable timer is very handy for when I just want coffee ready in the morning and prepare it the night before. Would recommend!"
mamaraye,5.0,"September 19, 2015","Good old Mr. Coffee!  After all sorts of experiments with high tech and low tech coffee machines, we have returned to the coffee maker of our honeymoon years.  Just does what he is supposed to do, and does it just fine."
Jennifer Mitchell,4.0,"July 11, 2016","Great price, reliable, makes coffee. No bells and whistles, but doesn't look half bad. Have to buy the metal reusable strainer, as it is not included in purchase. Overall, quite happy."
S. Hatfield,5.0,"July 4, 2014",Nice little machine that makes a good cup of coffee for the money.  Has a two different brew strengths and a carbon water filter for the basket.  Have been using it for quite a while now and haven't had any problems.  Would definitely buy this unit again.
Gilberto Velez,4.0,"August 20, 2013","We're very happy with this purchase.  It makes great coffee, simple to use and it looks great on our counter.  I gave it 4 stars because after the coffee has brewed and you remove the pot to pour a cup, it occasionally drips on the warming plate which requires some cleanup of the warming plate.  Other than that minor complaint, my wife and I are very satisfied with the purchase."
Prima Donna,4.0,"October 24, 2015",This is one of the best coffee pots I have owned. I researched it well and was skeptical. We like our gourmet brews and well you know Mr. Coffee started it all so I did not know they kept perfecting it. Until now.
SiobhanO'Kelly,3.0,"July 20, 2015","I ordered this machine in April but didn't start to use it until May1st.  I was SO excited when I began using the coffee pot..coffee addict that I am, it was coffeeYUMYUM at first taste!  I have to admit that I drink a lot of coffee over the course of a day, and have spent a lot of money on  machines that would have long and tasty lives.  I thought I had found the machine of my dreams, so just imagine the heartbreak I experienced this morning when the cheerful lights were all on, but the smell of fresh coffee was absent. You have no idea--really. (not to mention it is Monday.) Fortunately I am a fast learner and had stored a machine that I'd written on the box ""use only as a last resort"". whew.I loved this Mr Coffee machine and am very disappointed it lasted such a short time.  I don't know whether to order another one of these or just try something else. Any suggestions?"
always hopeful2,1.0,"September 16, 2015","Wow ! I don't know where to start ! Out of the box we had problems. Constant overflow from filter, water leaking from bottom, water never passing through filter to pot but instead overflowing inside, top never closed properly and last but not least it officially is DEAD. This is my worst purchase EVER from Amazon and I've been shopping with them for 15 years. Unfortunately I didn't think I'd be returning so destroyed the box but Amazon refunded me without question. Thank you Amazon !! Mr Coffee you should be ashamed at putting this on the market ! I will never buy another product from you again. We work hard for our money and it insults me when companies put this kind of crap on the market. Shameful !"
Peggy W Bullard,3.0,"March 1, 2016",I notified the company that no where in the manual did it state the coffee pot would beep 3 times when it's done.  Paper filters aren't good. It will overflow.
Paula Breece,5.0,"January 16, 2015","only had a couple of days but, works great so far, brews full pot in 10 min. keeps coffee hottttt. love it. I don't like luke warm coffee. program works, came on in am like suppose to, and auto shut off 2 hours."
Joseph Carpenter,1.0,"July 25, 2015","The hot plate burns the heck out of the coffee that it's just supposed to keep warm. I like Mr. Coffee, but I highly recommend buying one of their models that has an temperature adjustment dial that can turn down the hot plate (hint: keep it at or near its lowest setting for non-burnt coffee)."
Amazon Customer,5.0,"February 21, 2015",I'm giving this 5 stars for price and it does a great job brewing.  I didn't care for the water filter it came with... Caused an overflow... I ditched and it works great!!
Kyle,2.0,"December 7, 2016",The coffee maker worked fine but after only a few months the hot plate of it has stopped heating.  When I make a pot now I have to go back and microwave every cup to make it hot.
KA,4.0,"October 17, 2014","We drink about 3-4 cups in the morning between two of us.  This coffee maker is simple, works fine, doesn't burn my coffee when sitting on burner for 45 minutes.  Note, I have to use the STRONG option for what I consider normal strength coffee."
Beewoman,4.0,"February 13, 2018","What can I say - good, reliable, budget conscious, basic coffee maker.  Good old Mr Coffee!"
GLain,4.0,"October 2, 2016","This is my second Mr Coffee 12 cup coffee maker.  The first one, after 3 years of daily use, had the 'brew cycle' stop working; thus slowing the brew time to a 30 minute drip verses a 10-12 minute brew.  I do like the coffee maker and decided to stick with the same model  Mr Coffee for another go round.  Three months and is working fine."
Crystal Traver,4.0,"September 5, 2015","The first pot of coffee tastes funky even though I ran water through before hand but after that the coffee taste great. Have only had the coffee pot for about a month but so far no issues, works just as it should."
"Don R, NYC",5.0,"March 23, 2015",Highly recommend purchase of the stainless steel carafe DRD95 with your Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT coffee maker! It is well worth the price for a great combination of thermal café and a really good coffee maker. The machine actually warms up the carafe just enough to keep the coffee hot and fresh for hours.
L. Baranowski,5.0,"April 4, 2014",I love this coffee maker!  We've gone through two Keurig's and a small regular coffee pot in the last couple years.  We opted for an upgrade and love this coffee pot!  We use it daily.  It can be programmed to make coffee for you when you need it or just make it as usual.  Well made.  Was looking at other coffee makers this one was recommended.  It's great!
Robert Ludlum,1.0,"June 10, 2015",No way to put it other than after six pots it still made the worst tasting coffee I've ever had. The taste was plastic and medicinal and wouldn't go away. No wonder they were trying to clear these units out. Just move on to some other maker.
John R Wilsdon,5.0,"April 20, 2013","Has chrome type finish pot, timer, and 12-cup capacity. That is just what my daughter wanted. She tells me it also brews better than the old one that conked out! I don't think you can beat the quality and the price for a solid appliance. Shipping and servide were great. TY"
Justin,5.0,"November 6, 2014","Have had this machine for a year now. Use it every morning. Have no problems at all. Works well, works every time!I have no negatives to review about this machine. I will upgrade to a Bunn next....but only because I want that brand.This machine does a fine job at making coffee!"
John Young,1.0,"March 17, 2016",This coffee maker lasted less than 10 weeks.  Our previous Mr Coffee lasted 5 years.  Not a happy morning when your caffeine source doesn't put out.
Dale,4.0,"September 2, 2015",The carafe is difficult to pour from - especially when filling the brewer.  The top of the of the brewer retains water.  The filter consistently slips into the coffee grounds.  A little handle would make it easier to remove. Good coffee.
JOAM228,1.0,"February 26, 2016",Only had this coffee maker for 5 months and it stopped brewing. Very disappointed. Had a cuisinart one before and that lasted forever until the movers broke it. Guess it's worth paying the extra money.
Karen,4.0,"August 1, 2019",Looks nice. Brews good coffee.
JD,5.0,"April 2, 2014","We drink a lot of coffee.  Forget all the fancy pants makers.  This is a solid drip coffee maker.At this price you will not be disappointed.Simple, very easy to fill with water.  Makes good coffee.  Consumer reports was dead on with this item."
S. Mills,5.0,"September 9, 2016","So far (6 months) it's working very well. Makes great coffee. However, the last Mr. Coffee we had only lasted 2 years, so we'll have to wait and see how durable it is."
Joseph E. Catenaci,2.0,"July 18, 2016","Purchased in March of this year, Broke already😞, I've never had a Mr.Coffee stop working so fast. Wasn't even used everyday, switched back and forth between percolator and this machine. Now it will not brew, meaning bring water thru coffee grounds....so disappointed"
F. B. F.,4.0,"May 17, 2016",Stylish looking and it makes good coffee.  The only problem I have had is trying to set the 'delay brew'. After four tries I finally did it right but I still have to read the directions.
Duke,1.0,"November 17, 2015",Like the pot but it keeps turning itself off. That's very annoying. If I want it off ill turn it off. Itt also quit working after 4 months of use. I feel ripped off.
R + D Conken,1.0,"November 14, 2015","Piece of junk died just after 6 months! Horrible, hot plastic odor never did go away even with weekly vinegar cycles. I suspect whatever causes that hot stink likely shorted out the unit."
Maleficent,5.0,"October 14, 2014",Works great. It's my very first coffee machine and loving it.Now learning how to make the perfect brew. Some coffee beans will say 1- 2 spoons per cup while the coffee machine recommend 3 spoons of grounded coffee per 4 cups.
Zalester,4.0,"December 14, 2012","My main reason for buying this coffee maker was to bring into the kitchen some stainless steel to balance the ss refrigerator that I just purchased. It's quite attractive, easy to use, and makes moderately good coffee, keeping it at a perfect temperature. The ""strong"" button control is a good feature."
DRT,1.0,"July 7, 2015",worked fine for a month and a half. Then just quit working. Mr.Coffee replaced it with the same model and it quit working after a month and a half. Can't give the review less than 1 star but would if I could.
Debbie DiMarzo,5.0,"September 25, 2016",I really like my Mr. Coffee. The only problem I have with it is the 2 hour limit on the stay hot function. The last coffee maker I had was a 4 hour limit and that was perfect.
David R.,5.0,"October 2, 2014",Have only had this product for a month but has worked perfectly every time it's been used.  Very little of the plastic smell as reported by some. All of the options offered by this coffee maker are handy and nice. Who has two thumbs and a great coffee maker? ..........This guy!
C. Hovey,2.0,"April 16, 2016",I purchased this coffee maker according to its reviews.  Recently the hot plate decided not to work.Would not buy this product again.
Gary R.,4.0,"December 2, 2013","Easy to set, glass or metal carafe can be used, unit will detect which. Only complaint is that readout is small and not backlit, hard to see if not in direct light. Brew clock is useful, telling when 2 hours are up. Makes good coffee."
Russellbf,5.0,"March 2, 2015",Love this coffee maker. My husband and I enjoy being able to program it for in the a.m. The only down fall are on mornings when he leaves for work and I'm off... It has an auto cut off after 2 hours. But this will definitely come in handy when we forget to cut off!!
TinaGrey54,5.0,"December 31, 2014",Makes great coffee in time for me to wake up and hear the beeps telling that it is ready.  I love the fact that it keeps the coffee hot for two solid hours before shutting off.  I never have to worry if I have remembered to cut it off.
rob,1.0,"November 11, 2017",Purchased July of 2016.  Presently November 2017.  It now is taking 1 hour to brew a pot of coffee.  We only brew 1 pot a day and we clean the maker on a weekly basis. Would leave zero stars if possible
JWC - Dallas TX,4.0,"October 17, 2014","We recently went back to a Coffeemaker from the single server.  This has worked great, no funny taste or smell at all.The silver on this unit is very shinning chrome - I did not expect it to be so shinny. But happy with it for now."
Wasachi,1.0,"February 10, 2016",Died after about two weeks use....not impressed with all the electronics stuff....we're back to simple again!
DRP05,4.0,"January 16, 2014",This coffee maker makes a good cup of coffee quickly and quietly. The only drawback is the water fill design which is hinged on the left hand side rather than the back. So for a coffee maker placed on the right hand side of a sink while trying to use the faucet hose to fill it is nearly impossible. If I had known about the design I might not have purchased this particular model.
CandyFan,5.0,"July 26, 2017","These guys make the best machines - easy to use, easy to clean with ALL the basic features you need and no more!"
Dominick,4.0,"November 12, 2014",Have had this three weeks and works fine. We don't use filters because we have filtered water.No plastic smell.to get more coffee fill to weep holes on back of coffee maker. Use folded paper towel to prop lid open this will help keeping inside dry.
J. Melcher,5.0,"December 10, 2013","For the price, this is a gem. We have been messing around with inferior units for years. When I saw the recommendation in Consumer Reports and then saw the price on Amazon, I took the plunge. It's easy to pour the water in, there aren't grounds everywhere, it has great ""extra"" features, and most important, it makes consistently great coffee."
Gary Parker,4.0,"September 4, 2014",Love the coffee maker. My only problem is that I bought it in December of 2013 and it stopped working at the end of August in 2014. We have already ordered the same one again to replace it. We are hoping that this one lasts longer.
Amanda LeDoux,2.0,"February 21, 2014",We had done our research and this was claimed to be one of the best coffee makers by consumer reports.... This is not the case. This was given for a Christmas gift (one week after Christmas) and today 2/21/14 (so not even 2 months later) it has suddenly stopped worked. Of course this is past the 30 day return time so we'll have to go out and buy another.
Postalcop,5.0,"August 19, 2016",I bought this for my wife when our other smaller Mr. Coffee started leaking.  She like this coffeemaker so much better and says the coffee even tastes better too.
CSS,3.0,"November 11, 2015",Maybe I will give this a higher rating soon but sometimes this malfunctions and doesn't brew.  Not sure why yet.  I'm still giving it a chance.  It works great sometimes.  I want to love this.
LC,5.0,"May 29, 2012","After giving up on trying to win a better coffee maker on Quibids, did some research on inexpensive (but high quality) coffee makers. Found this to be one of the best & found the best price on Amazon. We love the programmable capability, convenience & great coffee that it brews. This is a great buy!"
Mike Sp,5.0,"May 26, 2016","I'm not a big coffee drinker, but my fiancé is, and with the delay brew feature, which mind you is sooooooo easy to use, even I figured it out, we can enjoy a cup right when we wake up.  It even looks so nice in our kitchen."
username,1.0,"November 28, 2018",After using this for only a month the glass carafe broke at the handle because of the weight of water!  The glass was extremely thin and to purchase a replacement carafe it runs close to $30.00!!  Hardly worth it!
Satisfied Customer,5.0,"November 13, 2011",Purchased the Mr. Coffee coffeemaker about 6 weeks ago. Overall very happy with the product. It makes a good cup of coffee. I particularly like the strong brew feature which I use everyday. For the money the Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT coffeemaker is definitely worth the price.
L. Lamour,5.0,"June 2, 2014",This is a fantastic coffee maker. Purchased it for my parents and I love the auto shutoff feature. It gets the coffee really hot. It turns off after 2 hours automatically. Totally recommend this product.
Mark & Susan,2.0,"June 2, 2014","Brews the coffee nice and hot, but the burner is so hot it burns the coffee within 15 minutes.  I'm going to look for another coffee maker with a variable temperature burner.  I liked the Cuisinart I had before (which this replaced), but it broke after three years, so..."
Alexandra Diaz de Reis,1.0,"April 12, 2014",Do not waste your money!Buy coffeemaker because I had heard very good comments from producer. But then met exactly one year is impossible to get a good coffee as the water spills out the bottom.Very disappointed in this article! Do not waste your money!
JKS,5.0,"September 4, 2017",18+ months of almost daily use & absolutely no problems
2CrochetHooks,5.0,"October 28, 2015",Great little coffee pot. I like how it stops when you pull the carafe out so I can sneak a cup. It also has a filter to make sure the water is nice and clean and doesn't affect the taste of the coffee.
T. Andrews,4.0,"October 13, 2012","This coffee maker is fine.  The first brew, however, I used the ""Strong"" button.  Coffee missed the carafe and landed all over the counter.  Yikes and yuck.  Since then, I don't ask for ""Strong"" coffee and every brew has been fine and my morning coffee is good to go."
FS,1.0,"April 16, 2017","This piece of crap quit working after one year! And the warranty is only one year.  Don't buy, invest your money in something that will last you years!"
Junglepilot,5.0,"January 31, 2014","We looked on consumer reports for coffee maker ratings and this one ranked very close to the highest, but the price was about a third of the highest ones.  It works very well and we are very happy with it."
Wade G. Harrison,5.0,"January 28, 2015","For the price, perfect. Makes good coffee and that's it. If you want coffee to stay hot for hours, or a higher end product then buy it. Works well everytime, a lot better than POS black and decker products I have had...."
Patrick. Erwin,3.0,"April 14, 2015",Coffee Maker is adequate for the price. We have used it for the last 2 weeks. The plate just doesn't get it warm enough. We have put on auto for the next morning and set to finish brewing 30 minuets before we get our coffee & always have to put in microwave to get it hot.
Gloria Carrell,2.0,"January 26, 2016","Two times (out of 2 tries) this coffee maker didn't deposit into the carafe correctly half way though brewing, flooding the basket and causing grounds to spill. Returned."
Cynthia Conroy,5.0,"March 23, 2015",Very easy to use and nice display. Works wonderfully. Wish I had a way to fill the reservoir other that the top as I would like to place this under a cupboard and I would have to keep pulling out and putting it back every time.
Erik Dean,1.0,"June 4, 2016","Ordered this the end of February. Worked great. Tried to make a pot today and just the heating element turns on. WILL NOT BREW COFFEE! like I said, worked great for all of 3 months."
JDAmazon Customer,5.0,"July 31, 2019",This has made good coffee consistently.  No problems.
N2Purpose,5.0,"March 9, 2015","Another great purchase.  I love this coffee maker, and the fact that it is programmable helps me wake up in the morning.  I did remove the water filter, seems like it gave the coffee a different taste."
Dennis Murphy,5.0,"January 7, 2014","I replaced an older model of Mr. Coffee with this one and I have to say they made a lot of improvements. AThe coffee is hotter, the auto shut off is great and the added water filter at the top of the basket is terrific. All around it's  just a better coffee maker."
Winebyrd,3.0,"February 4, 2016","My other Mr. CoffeeMaker died so I had to replace it with a new one.  This is a sleek looking machine, but it has a couple design flaws.  First,  the carafe is short and deep, and once it's on its burner, which has a black background, you can't see if the coffee is ""done"" unless you are able to give it an up close look.  Second, the removable filter carriage drops in easily, but fits only one way so you have to ""jiggle"" it to ensure it is properly situated before the lid is closed and flush with the water container.  Not a big deal, either way, but two changes that are not entirely convenient.  I also sense that the coffee isn't brewed as effectively as the older model.  I don't know what has changed with the brewing process, but it is different; so overall, the redesign has reduced the overall quality of the coffeemaker in general."
Rodney Robbins,5.0,"October 12, 2015","Awesome coffee maker.We're using it in our fifth wheel when we camp. Set the timer and coffee is ready when we get up. Shuts itself off, something our Bunn at home doesn't do. Nice feature, seeing as how we can't seem to remember to shut one off."
Drilling,5.0,"November 25, 2013",Makes great coffee.  The pot does not dribble and spill like some brands do.  Easy to fill  and easy to clean.  We like the features for programming coffee strength and time.  We researched  for a good coffeemaker and this was a recommended  item.
A. Schroeder,5.0,"February 17, 2015",This machine is the best value for the money. Can't beat it. Does everything it suppose to do. The only negative is that the clock is not back lit so you have to get right up on it to read it. Otherwise it's awesome.
Chasin 300,2.0,"February 14, 2017",Stopped brewing after 15 months.  How convenient.  It lasted about 3 months after the warranty expired.  Worked great until then.
James,3.0,"November 29, 2012","This is a pretty good unit. The main issue we have with the coffee maker is that the plastic seems to out gas quite a bit when you first start making coffee in it. There is a distinct ""plastic"" taste or something other than coffee. We were going to send it back then changed our minds as that plastic take subsided or we got used to it. My wife took it to work instead and we ordered different brand that makes the best coffee."
Stephanie Farre,4.0,"October 7, 2015","I'm not sure how to word it, but its pretty! Its classy and shiny and fits perfect in my granite top kitchen! I ran it through three times with filter until I got crystal clear water and no smell of anything! I love how there are two options for coffee strength!"
Anthony Capobianco,4.0,"June 7, 2013","So far, so good. Yes, this coffeemaker performs well for my needs but keep in mind that I do not use the timer function like some folks. All I do is set up the coffeemaker for brewing, then turn it on when I'm ready. Also, the coffeemaker looks good on my kitchen counter."
A Very Happy Amazon Reader,1.0,"May 11, 2016",It leaks. Coffee does not get or stay very hot. Poorly constructed. Bypass this coffee maker and look at others.If you make this purchase you will only regret it.
El Jefe,2.0,"April 9, 2016","I liked the coffeemaker, did everything I wanted it to and easy to program, but stopped working after six months.  The water no longer spits up onto the coffee grounds."
R. Steinecke,4.0,"December 29, 2012",We had this coffee maker for about a month..It works great and is easy to use. I like the glass carafe better than the metal one we had with our last coffee maker.It fits on the counter well and looks good...Easy to use and program. I would recommend it any time..
A. Pento,5.0,"January 9, 2015",This was bought for the workplace. We like it very much. The spout is large enough to pour quickly without spilling (a problem with our old machine). It is very attractive. The instructions are clear. The price couldn't be beat.
Professor,4.0,"August 7, 2013","I'm impressed with the ease of brewing and delighted with the beep that tells me it's ready.  As a I use my left hand to fill the reservoir and pour , I have to rotate the machine to the left for access, since the lid opens on the right and the reservoir is in the back."
Diane Bastian,5.0,"December 9, 2014","Wow.  I waited several years to buy this after a good review by Consumer Reports, but it was worth the wait.  Lowest price for a superb coffee maker and the coffee is way better than those little cups everyone seems to be pushing."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"January 7, 2016",Not even a year and it stopped working this morning. VERY frustrating to wake up and not have any coffee to be able to deal with this!
Lotus,5.0,"December 15, 2013","Nice looking, works great.  I wish the water compartment pulled out however.  When I accidentally filled it too full for the number of cups I wanted to make, it was easier just to put in more coffee than to try to empty some of the water."
cookie,5.0,"July 18, 2016",Arrived on time and in great condition. Very reasonable price and works great! Love the option to make brew strength strong or regular! Easy to clean too!
Jennifer,5.0,"June 22, 2018",Like the aspect of making the coffee bolder.
Twinky,5.0,"March 8, 2013",After reading about this unit in Consumer's guide I bought it and put my bunn in the basement.  This coffee maker is THE best.  We don't even have to use as much coffee as we used to in the old one.  The coffee is hot hot hot and we love love love it.
Mom of three,4.0,"August 4, 2013",Easy to set up and program!  Works every time.  Coffee tastes great!  The only thing I don't like is that it beeps 3 times when the brewing is finished.  It also beeps 3 times after two hours of being on and it shuts itself off.
bookends Pen #1745,2.0,"December 13, 2014",This post is okay-except I paid much to much for  it-I have seen this pot and better ones in local stores in my area much cheaper.  It was to bad I threw out the box it came in otherwise I would have returned it.
Jim - NYC,4.0,"November 10, 2013",Excellent brewing time: 14 minutes for a 12-cup pot with the glass carafe. Programmable good for delayed brewing for 24-hour period. Note the activated charcoal water filtration discs to absorb the chlorine are discontinued items hard to come by in retail stores.
Keith D Kidwell,5.0,"November 9, 2014",Makes good coffee. Mr Coffee holds up better than the expensive Krups coffee makers. I paid 150.00 for a Krups and they don't last much more than a year. I have had this for over a year and it still work great.
Michael,2.0,"February 24, 2013",This is the second Mr. Coffee machine where the warmer plate rusted after only a few months of use. If this issue was attended to it would get 5 stars. I threw my last one away after two years when the warmer rusted all the way through. This one started to rust after less than two months and I was very careful about keeping the carafe dry on the bottom. I honestly doubt I will buy another.
Glen T. Winstein,5.0,"December 25, 2011","Recommended by CR for drip coffee makers around $30.  The Specialty Coffee Association (SCAA) and National Coffee Association (NCA) say the ideal temp for brewing coffee is 195-205 degrees, and it does that.  You can choose regular or strong coffee, it's easy to keep clean, etc."
AsianSnacker123,4.0,"July 2, 2016","I'm not a coffee enthusiast, so I don't really care what the coffee tastes like as long as it tastes like coffee.It does the job and it looks nice on the counter"
CKue,1.0,"April 19, 2016",It only lasted 4 months. Now it just turns on and does nothing. Going right in the garbage can.
Daniel J. Griffin,4.0,"February 10, 2015","This coffee maker replaces a 6 year old Mr Coffee Maker which still worked OK,but the letters and numbers wore away. WE (wife and me) are very pleased thatthe new Mr Coffee makes good coffee."
John N.,5.0,"December 17, 2012","We had a Mr Coffeemaker that lasted close to 10 years.  Liked the size and features of the coffeemaker we had and wanted the replacement to be similarly equipped.  This one is nicer looking, fits the counter better, and we'll see if it last 10 years."
Robots16,1.0,"February 11, 2015",This coffee maker smelled. It did not release the coffee into the pot unless the pot was just right. I also couldn't set the clock. So since i couldn't set the clock i couldn't use the delay brew option. I was very disapointed that amazon chose to resell this coffee maker after someone returned it with these problems.
Andrew H.,1.0,"May 19, 2015","Coffee tasted terrible.  The smell and flavor of the plastic used to make this coffee maker was in every cup of coffee produced.  I thought this might go away after many cycles, but used the coffee maker almost daily for a couple of months and could still taste the plastic.  Thankfully this was so cheap that we just threw it away.  Would not recommend."
Maggiemayday,4.0,"July 21, 2013",Package arrived quickly but appeared to have been opened and examined. I used my older reuse able filter as one was not included and paper filters I ordered had not arrived yet. Thankfully my older filter fit properly. This machine works well and does not spill a drop!
Calamity,5.0,"November 2, 2015","I have bought top brands and spent way too much money on them over the years, only to have them last less than a year.  This one is so far the best and the price is way cheaper."
L. Hildebrand,2.0,"January 31, 2013","After just two weeks of use the functions on the coffeemaker  just stopped working.  The only function working now is the clock flashing at the preset time of 12:00.  I bought another coffee maker this same morning.  Who wants to go without coffee during the return/repair period.  I just need a refund!  I know, good luck with that.  Give Amazon 5 Stars.  They gave good instructions on returning item for a full refund and provided a printed paid return lable.Your the best."
Craig,2.0,"April 13, 2015","The unit stopped worked after 4 months.  Other features where great, so we bought a second unit and it has been working since then.Great score for features and use, but since the first failed so early, the reliability pulls down the rating."
RGP,1.0,"November 30, 2015",The plastic has a lot of chemical smells that won't go away!! Should have purchased a Krups coffee maker.
davo,3.0,"June 24, 2014","only bought this model because it was rated a best buy in Consumer Reports. The clock is hard to see and is not lit up like my old one was so it's not readable unless you have alight on and then only up close.The filter holder has to be just right or coffee will leak out everywhere,and it still drips some if you should pour a cup while it's still brewing which it should not do.My old one didn't..So I don't think it's worth the price . I may just go back to using my old $25.00 GE model"
She Devil,1.0,"December 27, 2015","Bought this on August 8, 2015 & loved it but this morning for some unknown reason it stopped working. Turned it on, all lights came o but it does not brew. Very disappointed."
Luke Berg,5.0,"September 15, 2016","This thing makes a great cup of joe. Grind your own beans, order the gold reusable filter, put it on Strong mode and now you're killing it in the morning."
Andrea,4.0,"September 11, 2013","I've been using this for a few months now and have loved almost every aspect of it.  It makes great coffee quickly, the delayed brew timer seems to work well, and for the most part the temp is spot-on.  Occasionally I'll find that the last cup is a bit too hot, leading me to wish there was a temp setting for the warming plate.  But at such an affordable price, you can't wish for too much!"
Alyssa Morgan,5.0,"February 25, 2013","I love this coffee pot! It looks sleek on my kitchen counter, it brews coffee pretty fast (compared to my old mr coffee pot). Its so easy to clean and simple to use. I was going to buy a 100 dollar cuisinart coffee maker and im very glad i chose this instead! I highly recommend it!"
Richard Lantos,5.0,"April 22, 2015","Very happy with this coffee machine. If I had one complaint it would be that the shut off auto timer is too short and I can't seem to find a way to change that. Otherwise, great coffee maker. I'm using the reusable Mr. Coffee GTF2-1 Basket-Style Gold Tone Permanent Filter with it."
Ella,1.0,"September 8, 2016","This coffee maker looks like those from 20 years ago. It came damaged and it leaked. Also, you could not see the whole digits on the clock"
M. Donald,5.0,"July 20, 2018",I am satisfied and would recommend.
Aimee Steinberger,1.0,"March 19, 2016","Worked well, but mysteriously quit working suddenly after just five months.  Avoid."
H. Tobin,5.0,"July 17, 2014","Like just about everyone else, I found this to be exceptional for the price.  It replaced a more expensive coffee maker that finally gave out and does everything the more expensive unit did and a much lower price."
J. Ibanez,2.0,"January 19, 2014","i dont like it at all, the design of coffee pot tends to spill coffee when pouring in a cup.  I wouldn't buy this maker again.  I had a cuisinart prior and I thought I give this one a try and i surely made a bad call on this"
homebrew37,5.0,"May 10, 2015","I use this almost every day. Easy to use and clean. Programming is also easy and works well. More than big enough for my needs. I am not a coffee aficionado, but it makes good coffee, IMHO."
Chase Kremer,2.0,"May 2, 2016","The filter clogs every 1 out of 10 brews. The coffee is generally weak and tasteless even on the ""strong"" setting. If it weren't for these two issues, it would've gotten a good review from me because everything else worked just fine. But if it can't make the coffee at least taste good, then to me, it's not worth the money."
M. Carli,5.0,"June 14, 2016",So far it has lasted longer than that POS Hamilton Beach model around the same price.  All I wanted was a basic coffee maker without too many bells/whistles that would eventually fail.  I think/hope I found it in this.
R. G. Wenger,5.0,"December 27, 2013","Great  coffee maker! I like the fact that it is black rather than white as our last ""free with the purchase of our ground coffee"" coffee maker which shows all the coffee stains and residue. The glass pot does not drip while pouring which is a big plus."
Phindog,5.0,"January 30, 2015","Works great, no problems and you can't beat the price. I had two Cuisinarts that both died within about a year after I bought them. This coffee maker is half the price and the coffee is just as good."
Marylou Wilson,5.0,"June 23, 2014",I like this coffee pot - The only thing is it shuts off in 2 hours rather than 4 - my husband gets up very early and by the time I get up I need to heat it up again - There may be a way to reprogram but I haven't found it!
Amazon Customer,3.0,"July 11, 2014",Makes good coffee.  Computer died after a few days.  Used to beep when done.  Now beeps 15 seconds into making the pot.  Timer doesn't work anymore.  Can't set the time.  Junk parts I guess.  Still makes coffee.
diana thornton,5.0,"November 26, 2016",My daughter love this my son broke her coffee pot so I had to buy her a new one. It will come in handy for her new apartment
Pumpkin,1.0,"March 22, 2015",First time I used it the clock dial steamed up.  Still worked alright and coffee was good but quit working after less than a month.  Clock still comes on when plugged in but nothing else works. Am returning for a refund.
Jae Melton,1.0,"October 11, 2018",Died after a month of use. Not worth it
Artsy Girl,1.0,"October 2, 2016","The previous purchase of this coffee pit lasted over 10 years, so we decided to buy it again. Warmer plate quit working within two weeks, so we are returning for a refund and will be buying a different brand."
KeithD,5.0,"October 22, 2013",We needed a cheap replacement for our old Mr Coffee (which worked great for 10+ years btw) that could hold more cups. This one is great. My only complaints are the Chrome looks cheap and does not look as good as stainless and the notion of water filters is just sillly an unnecessary.
terry,5.0,"January 8, 2019",Works very well
W Spanton,4.0,"June 26, 2016",Like it just a good basic coffee maker. Makes a good cup of coffee. Mr. Coffee seems to be able to cut out all of the unnecessary frills and give a good product that works well
tootoo,5.0,"June 3, 2015","We are glad that we have returned to Mr. Coffee. When our old Mr. Coffee gave up the goast, we were given a new black and Decker that we used for a very short period of time, ditched it and bought the Mr. Coffee."
retired,5.0,"July 8, 2014",Very happy that I chose Mr. Coffee!  had many coffee makers in the past and decided to go back to the original drip.The coffee actually tastes better then the previous ones I purchased.
harveygirl,4.0,"August 13, 2014","Your shipping can never be faulted.  Mr Coffee, is a step down from our old Cusinart coffee maker.  The taste difference is not comparable.  We will use our Mr Coffee as a backup only."
Online Consumer,4.0,"April 18, 2015",It's good for the price; my only complaint/suggestion is that the LED clock is almost impossible to read. We had a Cuisinart prior to this and their easy-to-see clock was a definite plus.
Laura,5.0,"December 20, 2014",Great coffee pot.  We've had it a month now and it consistently makes hot coffee every day.  The only remaining question is how long it will last.  I'll update this review if it's less than a year.
Danette,4.0,"October 12, 2015","No real problems with it, but don't completely love the lid design... Would be hard for a left handed person to pour water in...and the space to pour the water into is small..."
cac,1.0,"August 20, 2014","Don't waste your money!  Bought this coffee maker in June, after researching several brands.  This Mr. Coffee had good reviews, so I went for it.  HUGE MISTAKE.  The light on the clock went out after a couple of weeks.  We don't really use it, so not a huge problem.  Now, after only two months, the thing is completely inoperable."
Steffi,2.0,"September 2, 2013","The coffee pot had a ""strong"" and ""regular"" control for brewing. It worked only on regular and even when we used extra coffee grinds it produced a pretty weak pot of coffee. After a couple of days we returned it."
Vagrant soul,2.0,"August 28, 2014","I was very excited about this product when I read all the positive comments on Amazon. I needed a quick and easy coffee maker that was affordable. I have been using Chemex and French press for years, but sometimes, I felt lazy to go through the ritual of making coffee. So I thought of investing in an automatic drip coffee maker that had excellent consumer reviews. I overlooked the negative comments, which I shouldn't have. I faced a few issues in the first week which compelled me to return the item.1) The horrible plastic smell - I read several comments about this issue. I have owned coffee makers in the past that were made of plastic and I didn't have problems with the smell after a couple of washes (including the cheaper 4 cup coffee maker by Mr. Coffee). But this coffee maker is different. I ran several *wash cycles*, but the smell won't go away.2) Quality of coffee - Not good! When I compare the output with Chemex, I don't think the drip machine makes coffee that tastes even close to what Chemex has to offer. But that probably is not the fault of coffee machine and I am just spoilt as being used to a better coffee making process.3) Brewing process - I found it really weird that a few times when I brewed coffee, the coffee did not pour down into the glass pot. I checked the position of the pot, the filter holder, etc. The coffee just accumulated in the filter holder and was about to spill all over my coffee station. I feel that the item I received was defective as I haven't read any such complains from other customers.So overall, I personally did not like the machine (maybe I received a defective item). It has some good functions like delayed brew, though I doubt I will ever use it. It is definitely cheaper, but I feel like the entire process of making coffee and enjoying it is not ""fun"". I will give it a pass and maybe invest in a more expensive metal-made coffee maker in the future. Till then, I will enjoy my Chemex and French press."
Marylou,5.0,"June 26, 2014",Reorder....love this coffee pot..and it shuts itself off.Makes good coffee. I wear out a coffee pot every year.This one lasts about 18 months with constant use.That's a winner for this house!
Precious Piovanetti,1.0,"November 22, 2015",This makes the worst tasting coffee ever. I regret throwing out my old one before making sure this coffee maker was better.
Mickey,5.0,"July 6, 2017",Nice and makes a great cup of coffee
frank,5.0,"February 16, 2014","It is good...but:This 12-cup machine is far too large for me, as I drink less than 3 cups of black coffee a day. Of course you can put less water. But it still cost you much more ground coffee powders to brew strong coffee."
Beachside,5.0,"August 27, 2013","This Mr. Coffee is one of the best we have had.  No problems with it and it makes a great cup of coffee.  Spent a lot more money in the past for Krups, Cuisinart, etc. but this one is a good value for the money and worth it."
aconcernedconsumer,4.0,"July 3, 2014","Great for the price.  I do wish they would make it with the cone shaped filter.  I feel with the flat filters, you have to use more coffee to get the full flavor.  Easy to use and clean."
Gal in oregon,3.0,"March 2, 2015",Don't know why they put a clock on the coffee maker-can't see the time unless its daylight.Don't care for the two hour turn off timer either.Too many selections that really are not needed.
zdamaw,5.0,"December 22, 2015","So far, so good. Didn't take long for me to get use to waking up to fresh, hot coffee. Haven't had it long so we'll just have to wait and see how durable it is."
Amazon Customer,5.0,"July 29, 2014","I love this coffee maker. Made of good quality material. Looks really good on my counter. The only thing that I miss from my other coffee maker is the lighted clock, but that is not a deal breaker for me."
RL Reinking,2.0,"February 4, 2014",I ordered this as a Christmas present. It turned out to be slow and the LED lost half it's display in less than a month. I've had one from a big box discount store that I purchased a few years ago and still love it.
Robo,5.0,"March 5, 2015",Bought as a backup to our everyday coffee maker but was very surprised at the overall quality and features for the price. Shows you don't have to spend a $100 to make a good cup of coffee
F. R. Wuensche,5.0,"September 25, 2013","We've had some sorry experiences with Mr Coffee over the years, but after reading a favorable review in Consumer Reports, decided to give this model a try. We're very pleased with how it works, and the intuitive programming."
paul kirsey,3.0,"August 23, 2016","Works fine, perfectly adequate coffee maker.  The only problem is it has an obnoxiously loud beeping sound that goes off when the coffee is done and there is no way to turn it off.  The first time I set it to make some coffee for me in the morning it woke me up and I thought my fire alarm was going off.  Damn near gave me a heart attack."
Jennifer H,1.0,"October 1, 2016",Purchased item a year ago and now it no longer works. I will be contacting them to see what their costumer service is like and will keep you posted on outcome.
Oldblue,5.0,"August 2, 2013","Consumer reports swayed me to this coffee pot.  I have had Kitchenaide and Cuisanart brew central for years. Wanted something lighter and easy to use plus view feature for water. Love this pot, it is everything consumer reports said. Makes a great pot of coffee and the price was excellent.  I have told several people to buy this coffee pot. Pause feature is great.."
T. Smyers,5.0,"February 7, 2014",I bought this for my brother and he loves it compared to the one he had with the steel carafe. Makes very good coffee and the best part the lip on the carafe does not drip like others. I just hope it lasts a long time for him.
KauaiSeeHorse,4.0,"January 6, 2013","WHY I didn't get this MUCH Sooner ?  I don't know.  Makes GREAT COFFEE, It's FAST, and has the BEST no-Drip POUR of ANY I've EVER USED. Worth EVERY Penny.  I've Spent 5 times the cost, and NOT gotten as GOOD. ANYBODY would LIKE this."
Outbackwack,5.0,"January 7, 2015",The Cuisinart finally died and this had good reviews for less than ½ the price of the Cuisinart. We've had it for a year now with no problems at all. It's simple...
Shemp Howard,5.0,"August 19, 2014",Very nice coffee maker. It's easy to use. The water filter is a nice touch. One of the reason I got one is the look. I recently remodeled my kitchen so I wanted a nice looking coffee maker. I would definitely by one again.
chelli,3.0,"October 25, 2016","Works fine, but size is taller than listed by just a bit... but enough to barely fit under the cupboard anymore. This was a replacement for a Mr Coffee, older model."
aj,5.0,"December 9, 2013",Does make the great coffee it is supposed to do.  Also the carafe is set up to pour a full pot of coffee without rrunning all over the place  on the first cup it is perfect.  I am 68 years old and I have not had one to pour so precisely.
Theresa,5.0,"March 16, 2014",This is a great coffee maker at a great price. It looks good on our counter with our stainless steel fridge and has several brew options we didn't have with our last maker. It also has a water filter that is another nice option.
Brian Lee Burnett,5.0,"May 17, 2017",Great coffee maker.  SIMPLE to use.  Brews perfect pot each and every time.
Daniel A. Litvack,2.0,"September 26, 2015","This Coffee pot worked OK for about a year and a half, then it completely stopped working. It won't make a copy or even the heating element."
Kelly Austin,5.0,"November 6, 2013",GREAT coffee maker.Makes coffee.Easy to clean.Good size.Can use paper or metal filters.Great price.Shipped quick.Happy people here :)
firefly,5.0,"March 21, 2013",Great Product! Had coffee makers that cost more and did not brew this well! I purchased the reusable mesh basket to accompany it! Great Joe! Like the fact that it has brew levels! The stronger actually makes the coffee stronger!
John M.,1.0,"December 15, 2015","Complete garbage. Didn't even make it a month and a half. Now it brews the coffee, then beeps three times and shuts off. We had one of these previously and it lasted almost a year and it did this exact same thing. Not again. Find a better coffee maker. Would not recommend."
Byrne Family,4.0,"April 4, 2015","A great coffee maker at a good price. We especially like the thermal pot that you can buy for it. This is in fact the second one we've bought as the first was destroyed by a power spike (we live overseas), but we have an older model in the family that has been working for over 30 years"
Onebeat,5.0,"April 29, 2015","Great coffee maker. Makes good tasting coffee and is so affordable. I was going to buy a more expensive one, but so glad that I didn't. For your basic everyday coffee this is perfect."
cherry orchardist,4.0,"April 11, 2018",Our back  up now...went to a Keurig.
"Hugh C. Thomson, Sr.",5.0,"February 26, 2013","Exactly the way that Consumer Report described it and rated it. My only complaint is that I should have purchased the vacuum pot. My former Mr. Coffee, that I've had for over 15 years, I think, came with a vacuum pot which keeps the coffee hot. Now I have pour my coffee from the glass container into my old vacuum container, which continues to keep my coffee very hot for about two or three hours."
Chris Collier,1.0,"October 18, 2015","Worked great for 3 months, then it just stopped brewing halfway through a brew cycle and never worked again. Powers on, can select brew but never starts the cycle anymore."
Moots70,3.0,"October 5, 2015","It's o.k.  A little cumbersome to load.  I liked my previous Mr. Coffee better and probably should have just purchased a new decanter, but I didn't, so there you are."
Pam Abney,5.0,"August 21, 2014",Nice this was the greatest buy yet.  Water filter all the programing you could want. Simple to follow instructions. Beeps when finished brewing and after the 2 hour hold just before the automatic shut down.
Brian Rogers,5.0,"March 7, 2018",Use it every day and it does a great job.
Linda Bee,5.0,"May 23, 2015","It doesn't cost an arm and a leg, it looks good, it makes a decent cup of coffee, it can be used with permanent or paper filters, and it is easy to clean.  Delivers as advertised."
Sissy S.,1.0,"August 13, 2016",This does not make a full pot of coffee. I make 12 cups it makes 10. At times it will start dropping after its finished brewing.
M. ROSS,5.0,"July 16, 2016",Just got it..and it WORKS  BEAUTIFULLY....SO FAR. Can't beat the price for the realibility. Quick delivery.Easy transaction.
Mike,1.0,"January 31, 2016",First couple of cups are NOT hot.  Lukewarm at best.Heavy plastic smell In the coffee brew basket as well.
Amazon Customer,4.0,"July 10, 2018",Just what I wanted
Larry L. Kiser,1.0,"April 17, 2017","I bought this in August of 2016 to replace a previous Mr Coffee model, whose carafe was broke.  But it was cheaper to replace the whole machine with this one.  Now 8 months in, it breaks and will not attempt to brew anything.  I will not buy Mr Coffee, ever.  I purchased a competitor because I dont care for this brands lack of reliability."
Amazon Reviewer,5.0,"February 27, 2012","This unit replaced another Mr. Coffee maker.  Used Consumer Reports recommendation to guide us on this.  So far, works well--we wake up with the smell of fresh brewed coffee in the morning and the coffee seems to be brewed as we like it."
arturo salinas,1.0,"February 12, 2013","First pot of coffee was full grounds? 2nd. pot poured coffee on counter because pot was not centered with handle faceing forward.Timer did not work? Could not see the clock to dark,had to use flash light? Stopped using it after the 3rd pot. Pot was made to use 2 different pots a steel vac. pot,also a glass pot. and they were not the same size so you had to make sure the glass pot was centered.The timer numbers were always fogged up."
Richard,1.0,"August 22, 2015",It comes with some filter that if you use it causes the coffee basket to pop out during brewing and pours coffee and grounds all over counter
Callista's Girl,5.0,"December 4, 2012","I researched this thru Consumers and they rated it very highly.  Couldn't find it in local stores so I went to Amazon, got it for less than Consumers said it cost.  With all the money I spend at Dunkin Donuts I decided it was time to get a good coffeemaker for myself (my husband isn't a coffee drinker).  Next purchase will be the thermal carafe. Love this coffeemaker!"
Jenny,2.0,"May 6, 2016","While it worked, I enjoyed this coffee pot. I received this as a gift July 2015 and used it once daily until it died May 2016. I like my appliances to last longer than 10 months. Thankfully, I did not experience the plastic smell or taste mentioned by other reviewers. I will not be purchasing a Mr. Coffee product in the future."
Alisa,2.0,"January 19, 2016","Three months in, probably using it 5-6 times a week to brew half pots of coffee, it broke. Lights still on but not brewing coffee. Looks nice, but a piece of junk."
Jim Staron,4.0,"October 3, 2015",Makes good hot coffee.  The beeps that go off to signal the end of the brewing cycle is now going off about half way through the cycle. Not sure why it is doing this. Other than that it is a good purchase for the money.
Connie Porcher,5.0,"February 10, 2015",Great coffee maker for the price!  I ordered this to be shipped to Mexico during a 6 week stay.  We needed something to create a larger brew that the small 4-cup machine provided in our rental.  This is a luxurious machine and was a great price even considering the shipping charge to Mexico ... and we had it in hand within a week!  What's not to love?!
Farhad Navaei,1.0,"September 7, 2015",It was so embarrassing! I bought it as a housewarming gift for a closed friend. Today I found out that the it only worked for two months.
Carla,5.0,"February 27, 2015",I purchased this for my daughter for a house warming gift. She was so happy for it. I am glad she is not spending $4 on a cup of coffee! I don't think you can tell but it comes with a water purifier. I only found out when my daughter showed me the package when she opened it. So something nice to know.
R Code,4.0,"October 25, 2014","It makes a great cup of coffee, easy to clean and operate.  The notification beep that brewing is done is not too loud or annoying.  This is a replacement for two cuisnarts that BURNT up."
dan b,5.0,"June 26, 2013","It's a really good coffee maker, especially for the money.  Looks great and is programmable.  After a couple uses, the brewing time went from 15 minutes to about 7.  Works as well as any I've had, including the Cuisinart."
Dr. Judith Lowenthal,1.0,"October 24, 2017",Stopped working after 4 months.  Steam from coffee damaged the electronics and it doesn’t work anymore
Iguy,1.0,"May 31, 2016",Another piece of junk high ratings didn't help ours lasted 2 1/2 months won't even turn on
Joe Cseko,1.0,"October 2, 2015","Piece of garbage. This is just a poorly designed, poorly built coffee maker. The brew strength setting does nothing, either."
Amazon Customer,5.0,"December 20, 2015","Fab as always! Had this same model for over a year and loved it. It died right after thanksgiving. Bought this one as a replacement. If you want a simple, reliable coffeemaker, with a timer, clock and adjustable brew strength ,looks good on the counter, that dosen't break the bank but brews a good cup, this one is for you.All I care about is a cup of coffee that tastes good,a coffeemaker that dosen't blow hot coffee allover the counter. I had a higher end much more expensive coffeemaker 3 years back and it did just that. Everyday! Grounds and all.I prayed for it to just give out for good.:) This is just a simple reliable coffeemaker. They don't last forever, but, you should get about 1 1/2 to 2 years out of it. Buy good coffee and Enjoy."
meredith Faix.,4.0,"March 26, 2013",Mr. Coffee has had enough experience to design a coffee maker very well. The paper filter fits the basket properly. The unit beeps when finished. My only disappointment is that the lid opens from the side requiring access to the side to fill the water reservoir.
Matthew conley,1.0,"December 4, 2014","Junk. If filter, filter holder, and pot aren't in exact 1/10 of a millimeter position, you end up with coffee all over your counter top, and grounds inside the machine that are very difficult to clean out. My $10 brewer from Walmart works way better, but with no timer. Save yourself the headache and buy a cheaper one or a spend the money on a better model"
Medea Lee,5.0,"June 3, 2014",I bought this coffee maker because it was highly rated by consumer reports and so far I haven't been disappointed.  It has worked well and I like the way it notifies you when the coffee is ready.
Mark,4.0,"September 23, 2016",Same one that my mother has. I bought it because hers has been reliable and so far it holds true for mine as well.
Roxana H. McRoberts,5.0,"April 24, 2013",This is my third Mr. Coffeemaker and what I like about this one is the looks and the fact that is has a water filter included. It also hassettings for regular or strong coffee. I highly recommend this coffeemaker
Mladen,1.0,"January 8, 2017","I went through 2 of these and neither of them lasted a full year. If you are buying a drip coffee machine for your home, you will probably be drinking coffee for the rest of your life and so maybe it's wiser to just buy a high quality drip machine."
Ron,2.0,"May 11, 2014","Does not change brew strength as advertised.  Got a different model from Mr. Coffee in exchange, which tells me they don't know how to fix it. Shame too, I bought the thermal carafe for it also."
South Paw,2.0,"September 9, 2014",The machine and water heated from this machine reek of plastic.  I've run hot water through it several times (instructions say just once before first use) and it is not improving.  I hate to think of what is coming through in the water not to mention the taste of coffee it would make.  I'm going to try the vinegar cleaning rinse to see if that offers an improvement.Also a major negative in my house is that the lid to the reservoir opens to the left forcing one to pour the water with their right hand.  For 90% of the population who are right handed this is fine but my husband and I are both left handed so this is problematic in our house.
Grin,5.0,"July 24, 2014","I bought this coffee machine for my parents. They had a previous version that didn't worked properly. Now, they are happy..The coffee is good and strong. The warming system works properly."
momof3yankees,4.0,"November 19, 2013","Brought this for my nieces housewarming and she loves it. It looks very nice and it works well. She seems to like it. I personally can't state I have one yet, however will be purchasing again for myself."
Scott Cabot,5.0,"June 25, 2014",You don't have to spend a whole lot to get a great cup of coffee. This brews slow but you get a delicious HOT cup of you favorite coffee. Believe me it is nice and  hot like coffee should be!!
Robert E,5.0,"September 15, 2015","fit our needs perfectly. the pot for our last coffee maker always dripped when you poured a cup of coffee, not this one. Setup and programming were very easy."

David Q. Ziegler,5.0,"December 6, 2013","Mr. Coffee makes the best coffee makers, and at a reasonable price. Our first Mr. Coffee lasted 20 years, and the only reason we replaced it was because we needed a bigger coffee pot."
Arizona Griz,4.0,"October 16, 2012","If you are looking for value, you can not beat this product. It uses 2 filters so the water is filtered while the coffee is filtered. You can spend more money on a similar product but you won't get better tasting coffee."
Brian Packard,5.0,"October 10, 2015","Very nice coffee maker, the coffee tastes great and it is super easy to clean. The water filter makes it taste so much better. Very affordable and sturdy."
Kylie Harryman,2.0,"January 8, 2016",This coffee pot is ok. It has a nice compact design. The problem I have with it is it comes on when you push the delay start button and then it will not shut off.  We have to push the button multiple times or unplug it to finally get it to shut off and then start the process over.
Josie,5.0,"January 31, 2013","I bought this after returning another more expensive Mr Coffee pot that leaked all over my counter. This one has been awesome, no leaking whatsoever.  Makes great coffee, easy to program, easy to clean - I love it!"
Gio,5.0,"August 15, 2015","This has seriously improved our mornings! In the future, I will probably purchase the thermal coffee pot to be able to keep my coffee warmer longer. Although, at my house we go through coffee so quickly that it rarely cools! This gives you the ability to have coffee waiting for you when you wake up, and to choose the brew strength for every pot! Great product!"
Brad Bonnell,5.0,"January 2, 2014",Had several Bunn coffee makers and after a year or two they would leak. Bought this one with hopes of quality. So far so good. I wont spend 100's on Bunn again. Thank you Mr. Coffee. Love the features.
Sherry Rogers,4.0,"April 9, 2015",Makes Great coffee but could use 2 improvements:1 - time display not lit so can't see time easily2 - programming for delay brew difficult without both the manual and a flashlight (to check the time)
Drew Fobes,5.0,"June 18, 2014",Seriously - look no further!  I couldn't be more happy with this coffee maker.  It was a great price for an absolutely fantastic product.  It is good looking and easy to use and program.
AT,4.0,"March 31, 2013","This coffee maker makes a pot of coffee a lot quicker than my old one.  Coffee tastes fine, I'm not sure what the problem was a lot of other reviewers mentioned with bad taste.  I would definitely buy it again."
james ross,3.0,"May 16, 2015",good coffee.no bad taste or smells.BUT needs a switch to turn off the alarm when coffee is done.when I get up at 4:00 a.m..i either make coffee OR wake the kids.

GK,3.0,"November 23, 2013","Simple coffee maker. You get what you pay for. It does the trick. As a law student with roommates, we make a boat load of coffee. I don't recommend this if you are a coffee connoisseur or make a lot of coffee. Not the easiest thing to clean."
Carol,5.0,"September 5, 2013",Makes excellent coffee.  Carafe allows for spill-proof pouring.  My last coffee pot died in 6 months.  The true test will be how long this one will last.  Have only had it about 2 months.
Cuyamungue,1.0,"September 21, 2015",Lasted 13 months and completely died. Sad about coffeemakers that only are made to last a year. Will not buy again.

GREGG HARRIS,2.0,"December 23, 2015",Bought this in April 2015. It stopped working in Dec 2015. Waiting to see how the manufacturer handles the Warranty. It is warranted for one year.
Sherry Dilley,4.0,"September 9, 2014","I had some trouble when I first used this coffee maker but quickly realized that it was because I wasn't using a coffee filter that fit correctly. Once I changed filters, the overflow problems ceased, and we were able to use the program feature."
TECHNO ROJO,1.0,"October 1, 2015",Used at least 5 times a week and now it no longer works. Very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone...looking for something better.
Judith A. Duffy,1.0,"March 12, 2016","Bought this coffeemaker in July 2015, and it died in March 2016.  The heating element won't go on anymore.  I think a coffeemaker should last longer than that, when used just once a day!  Before that it made decent coffee."
Juli,3.0,"May 19, 2015",We have one for home and I got one for work; it's OK I would prefer that I didn't have to reach to the back to poor the water and try not to pour it into the grinds.
Amazon Customer,1.0,"August 16, 2016",Stopped being a coffeemaker after 7 months  of morning only use.  Glad we kept to old one for backup.  It did its job for 5 years.  I suppose some kind of restitution would be wishful thinking.
Megan,2.0,"July 31, 2016",This broke after using it nearly daily for just nine months. Pretty disappointed. I expected at least two years out of it.
Amazon Customer,5.0,"April 11, 2015","We've been using this coffee pot for three months now, and it's performing perfectly!  Our last Mr. Coffee lasted nearly five years. If this one does as well, we'll be super happy!"
Vivian,4.0,"December 28, 2013","Nice looking and efficient. Easy to use. Still figuring out how to use the timer so that's the only reason I didn't give it five stars, although that is probably my failure, not the machines."
magda martino,5.0,"June 7, 2016",With not knowing what's in the water today. I love the idea that it filters the water which makes coffee taste better.
Shawn,4.0,"February 18, 2016","I have no problems with my new coffee maker. I hung my black light Elvis poster above it to match the plasti-chrome finish. It keeps coffee at the right temperature. The beep to let me know its done is useless, because I'm usually standing right by it waiting for the coffee to finish brewing. It does stay moist (wet as heck) inside the unit, but I use it twice a day, and just rinse the inside out every now and again. I didn't smell any plastic burning when I first used it, because I had purchased some Seattle's Best No. 5 Dark Intense coffee and that's all I could smell for a week. I'm happy, and a bit giddy with my purchase, but it may be the dark intense coffee.Edit: It lasted 3 years and 4 months. It died yesterday. RIP Mr Coffee maker. Elvis will miss you."
Jana P.,4.0,"April 27, 2015",Have had this quite a long time (over a year) and find it works very well. It's a little hard to fill as the opening is rather small but that's not a big deal.
Derrick A.,5.0,"September 4, 2013","This was a great deal on a coffee pot.  I use this thing every singe day with no issues.  About once or twice a month, I run a cycle with vinegar and water.  This keeps it clean and running well."
smith,5.0,"September 13, 2016",so far so good. my 6 year old boy makes the coffee for me every morning~ so you can say it's easy to use…
James Lockwood,5.0,"August 24, 2015",Absolutely the best kitchen coffee maker. I have several unique coffee makers and this if the most efficient by far.
Bill,4.0,"June 14, 2014","I've had several Mr. Coffee coffeemakers and they all work great and cost far less than most other. The glass carafe is fragile, you gotta be careful, but replacements are available."
Ted,5.0,"November 22, 2015","Great coffee maker, especially for the price. Works as advertised and is user friendly. Does everything I want it to do in a coffee maker."
Gos,3.0,"May 12, 2016",broke after two months. while it worked it was awesome especially for the price
DJANLEL,1.0,"September 3, 2015",This coffee maker broke after 6 months of light use.  Water flows out through the bottom whenever you fill it.  Terrible quality.
Zebra2749,2.0,"December 16, 2013","The coffee maker does work and makes a pot of coffee, HOWEVER, it takes too long and the coffee is just warm not hot !!  So, if you do not mind having to heat up your coffee up in the micro wave go ahead and buy this piece of junk.  There are a lot of other problems with this coffee maker I suggest spending a little more money and get a better product."
Jim H.,5.0,"September 26, 2015","Mr Coffee 12 cup coffee maker. What can I say, it gets the job done. It is easy clean, easy make coffee, and looks good on the kitchen counter."
Patricia E. Nalitz,1.0,"July 13, 2015",Bought this in Feb 2014 and it quit working mid 2015.  Not a good purchase.  Bought a different brandthis time around.
Bob,5.0,"July 11, 2014",First one worked so well I bought a second model for a second home.  It works even better as the water quality is much higher at the second home.  May have to take some water back to the first location.
Laura,3.0,"December 21, 2015","This coffee maker has lasted just under two years.  We had the same model before that and the same problem developed.  Brewing takes longer, up to 40 minutes for 12 cups.  When brand new, this machine is great and brews in 10 minutes."
Amazon Customer,1.0,"May 25, 2015",At first it worked great but quit working after a short period of time. Poor quality as it quit working a couple days after the date I could send it back

Roger Benefield,5.0,"November 25, 2013","Works great and makes very good coffee. I am well pleased with this coffee maker. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good, reasonably priced coffee maker."
PAULINE,2.0,"March 30, 2016",Lasted only 6 months! I'm having to order another one because it has the best reviews for the money...not happy though!
W Lawrence,2.0,"September 15, 2014",I've had this for a couple of months and it still emits a strong plastic smell in the reservoir that I am sure also affects the taste of the coffee.  Otherwise it works o.k.
Kindle Customer,1.0,"November 4, 2015",Bought in June 2015 and died today. Didn't even last 5 months!UpDATe: honored warranty and have had the second one going for 2.5 years now. Must have got a lemon first time?
David in SW VA,5.0,"November 4, 2013",Brews fast and hot.  We go through these pretty fast in our family business so we don't like to spend too much.  This one exceeds expectations. Delay feature handy.  Plate keeps coffee quite hot.
Berkley,5.0,"February 28, 2015","This is a great, albeit basic, coffee maker.  I got this to replace my old one that was the exact same model and had lasted over 7 years.  I highly recommend this product.Seller was great, shipping was fast."
R. McDonald,4.0,"June 8, 2016",Nice coffee pot. Doesn't hold quite as much as our old coffee pot did but still a quality coffee pot for the money.
T. Viars,1.0,"November 5, 2016","It makes good coffee.....but it is the 3rd one to die in nine months or less. Rediculous. I will never buy again. If it even lasted a year, I would consider for the price, but the last one I bought in April. Wish I had purchased from Walmart because at least I could have returned."
Sarah Hansen,5.0,"January 29, 2014",This is by far the best coffeemaker that I have had.  I have had some very expensive coffeemakers and they leaked and dripped and they did not work as well as this one.
Lee,3.0,"September 25, 2016",It works fine. After buying this I discovered a cone filter probably uses grounds more efficiently than this. I seem to go through grounds faster with this machine and I still drink the same number of cups.
gh,3.0,"September 13, 2012","This is a good coffee pot for the money I use it everyday, and also set the timer. I use paper filters, they work well. The carafe is good although you do have to pour the water into the base slowly to avoid dripping. I would recommend this product to anyone."
C. Miller,3.0,"March 5, 2014","Kind of disappointed that the clock didn't light up, but not a big enough deal to return it as three days with no coffee was all I can handle.Otherwise what's to say  It makes coffee."
The F.,5.0,"February 23, 2015",For this price you can't go wrong. Having owned so many high end makers over the years we forgot what a great product Mr. Coffee makes. It looks great and works well.
Susan Love,5.0,"October 22, 2013","Makes delicious coffee, excellent price, and has an updated look.  I'll never buy another Cuisinart .  I've owned two Cuisinarts, and the coffee never tasted like what Mr. Coffee brews; plus, they were more than triple the price."
Ana,5.0,"June 18, 2013","Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Chrome its a quick coffe maker, beautiful and very practic, its not too big, the size is perfect. Im happy with my new coffe maker. Thanks."
Joe,5.0,"June 26, 2016",I have been very pleased with this product.  Very user friendly and makes a great cup of coffee for a very reasonable price.  All I asked for.
J. Needham,2.0,"August 19, 2014",Bought after reading great reviews.  Worked great for seven months ( one pot per day ).  Then the clock/timer couldn't be read due to condensation inside the panel.  Then at eight months it died completely.  Expected more from a Mr. Coffee.  Think I'll go with another brand this time.
raynpat,5.0,"December 1, 2014","Just what we wanted for a reasonable price.  Product arrived on time, worked, minimal effort required to set up.  Equal to others Mr. Coffee's we used in the past."
That Melissa,5.0,"September 29, 2014","I make a flavor coffee every morning.  The brew gives you the option to make it stronger, which is a great feature. The heat element keeps it warm for a long time.  Its an easy machine to clean."
Chief,5.0,"October 4, 2012",Had this coffeemaker for almost a year now and it still brews a great cup of coffee.Purchased the carafe and permanent filter alone with the coffemaker and have experienced no problems with either.A great buy.
R Powers,1.0,"August 18, 2017","Quit after 9 months...thought it would last a couple of years. Cost more to return than it's worth. Went budget store and replaced with another brand with none of the ""special features"". Won't waste anymore money on Mr. Coffee stuff!!!!"
j,1.0,"March 13, 2014","Didn't push the carafe in all the way one morning and water overflowed in the brewing basket.  Oops.Cleaned out coffee maker, and after that, no lights lit up.Pushed the unlit ""brew"" button and it still brewed coffee (twice) but had to unplug it in order to turn it off.Too late to return (by ONE DAY).Very disappointed with this product.It was more expensive than other brands, but I thought Mr. Coffee would certainly be able to make a decent coffee pot!Wish I had known that getting it wet would break it.  I mean, it is made to hold WATER, after all ...Worth ZERO stars in my book."
Peter W. Petschauer,5.0,"September 11, 2013",The machine is being used by several people every day and it has held up very nicely under this pressure. The machine is easy to use and the coffee it produces is consistent. I recommend it highly.
N. Baum,5.0,"June 2, 2016",Have had it a little over one month now and we love it. This is our first coffee maker with a timer and that has been nice waking up to already made coffee. The filter is a nice bonus as well - can't say I've really noticed a difference in taste though. I do wish the strong brew setting was even stronger though.
Toto,5.0,"October 21, 2015",I use this every morning at my job and works perfectly. It's really easy to load and I like the fact that it will stay hot for a while.
darius baker,1.0,"May 19, 2016","I bought this product July 31st 2015 I didn't use it until October 2015 when I moved into my new home, it's now May 19th 2016 and the coffee maker does not work anymore , I used it moderately 1 to  3 days a week. Wouldn't buy again!!!!!!!"
Smootdot,2.0,"February 11, 2013","Why I don't like it.I cannot get rid of the plastic aftertaste that is present when boiling water within this unit even after replacing the unit, washing, deep cleaning, vinegar, hot water, and using dish soap to wash the water tank.Why I like it.Cheap,Convenient, Fast and makes a Consistent, although bad coffee.If you're looking for a pure coffee taste, this is not a product for you, heavy plastic aftertaste."
akearringlady44,5.0,"September 13, 2013",This is the best I look it up and went though lot of web site. For the money is the best. And they don't cost a lot and it say no leaks.When you use the morning timer.  You will love it. Carol R
eruff,1.0,"November 5, 2014",This coffee pot overflows atleast once a week.  The filter HAS to be in the perfect spot or it will overflow.  It is very annoying.  I would never purchase this pot.
Catherine Topley,3.0,"October 25, 2016",I only gave this three stars because it worked great for the 8.5 months that it worked and then just stopped working. Lights come on but it doesn't brew.
WHO CARES?,4.0,"August 11, 2015",i do not liked the two (2) holes in the back of the water tank. but it sure makes a better cup of coffee than my last two (2) coffee maker.
Kpoindexter,2.0,"February 5, 2016",Only dispenses the water on half of my coffee grinds.
Kelly Donoghue,5.0,"November 5, 2015","We had the caraf-less kind for years because we thought it kept the coffee hottest, but after using this the last few months I really think it's as hot or hotter and much more simple to use. I wanted fancy but settled for this and I'm glad I did. I can go fancy somewhere else in the kitchen now!"
Dennis Hamlet,5.0,"July 8, 2016",It showed up fast. I had one of these for years and the heating element finally burned out. So I ordered this one so if it's the same as the old one and it's going to be great. Look forward to using it.
VA customer,3.0,"April 28, 2014","Carafe has already broken after three weeks.  Thin glass, but otherwise well designed.  Ordered the thermos to replace it.  Thermos works very well, but can only brew six cups."
QualityHunter,5.0,"January 30, 2014",This coffee maker looks really nice and has some great features like a brew timer and automatic adjustment if you are using the glass decanter or you have the steel carafe that can be purchased separately.
Steinbeckfan,5.0,"August 23, 2015","This is a great value. I refused to believe you can get great coffee from an inexpensive machine, but it works flawlessly almost 6 months later."
L. E. Nevolas,4.0,"June 19, 2016",This was a requested gift and the person who has it said it makes a better cup of coffee than his Keurig.
KLo,5.0,"May 19, 2015","Works very well. Automatically detects which carafe is being used. Just be aware if using stainless carafe, coffee maker shuts off after it is filled."
Samuel Brown,2.0,"December 13, 2015","Lasted about 18 months before one of the rubber tubes that moves the water through the heater just broke. Now when I put water in, it pours straight out of the bottom.I thought it would last longer than this."
James Grunstra,5.0,"November 30, 2013",Easy to program. Brews an excellent pot of coffee whether  filled and set for 12 cups or a lesser number. I like the fact that the finished product is hot but not scalding and there is an auto shut off to compensate for those of us who are prone to forget to turn the power off.
rebs,5.0,"June 15, 2013","I think this is a great coffee maker.  The coffee stays hot, and one can choose a stronger brew which I love.  The price was right.  Amazon has been wonderful for ordering everything I need."
Mighty mike,5.0,"August 9, 2015","I wanted to originally give this 4 stars because it does have a plastic taste the first few times you brew coffee.  We even did a good 5 cycles of vinegar and water in the machine beforehand just because of reading reviews about it.  After a good 3 days of making coffee, the plastic smell and taste went away, so no worries.  Terrific coffee now!"
JustTryin2Help,1.0,"September 9, 2016",lasted 7 months! I had a generic Dollar Store coffee maker that outlasted this one. VERY disappointed!
Amazon Customer,5.0,"April 16, 2018",Good
William Stout,5.0,"October 8, 2017",Great Product. Very satisfied with it.
TwoFarmDogs,1.0,"December 9, 2015",Ordered on 10/31/15.  1/11/16 quit working.  A big disappointment - ZERO stars!~~~~~
Deb,5.0,"August 30, 2012",This coffee pot sure was a great value.  Would buy another one.  The only thing that is a little awkward is the water filter but that is just something that I have to get used to.  I recommend this to everyone.
Martha McCormick,1.0,"August 10, 2013","This machine is supposed to select glass or themal carafe by sensing the replacement of the glass carafe with the thermal carafe.  However, I have tried every sequence of how to make coffee in this machine (coffee grounds in first, then water, then place glass carafe or  first water, then coffee grounds, then glass carafe, or water, glass carafe then coffee etc etc) so that it uses the glass carafe option (without which the heat plate will not keep the coffee warm).  No matter what, the machine sets up with the thermal choice so that the coffee is not kept warm.  This might be tolerable if the coffee tasted okay - but it doesn't even seem to make good tasting coffee.  I do not recommend this coffee maker at all and regret that I purchased it.  It stinks.  We selected this based on Consumer Reports recommendation - now I seriously question their options."
B. Lynn Wynn,4.0,"November 17, 2015",I hate the beeps! But love the coffeemaker. I wish there was an option to turn off the speaker without disassembling the thing.
Lex Brody,5.0,"March 17, 2018",Excellent
Mrs. G,2.0,"May 4, 2015",We only make coffee once a day and this coffee maker lasted less that 9 months! I gave it two stars because it made good coffee while it lasted.
linda,4.0,"February 10, 2014",love the timer feature and the pricing was great - replaced my older Mr coffee although it was still working just wanted a new one. would recommend any of the Mr coffee makers
Jriche,5.0,"December 22, 2012","Love it once I pulled it out the box. Looks fancy and it works like a charm. At first, I could not figure of where the extra water filter went but once you get it in, its in. Its very quick at brewing coffee, easy to clean, and easy to use. Not too big. Perfect for a small apartment kitchen."
Betsie,4.0,"April 14, 2014",The coffee pot is working as expected.  It is making much better coffee than the pot I replaced.  I only wish the setting between regular and strong was graduated.  You must select one or the other and cannot select a point in between.
Cheechako J,2.0,"January 8, 2014","This did not prove to be what I expected, since it was a CR best-buy I thought it would be nearly perfect. The company sent me a replacement and it does not work as described either !"
James,5.0,"January 1, 2014",Very easy to use and makes good coffee. Relax and enjoy the aroma while the machine is doing its work. No more running to Dunkin Donuts in the cold. Good product and best price.
Melisa,1.0,"July 31, 2016",Horrible! Won't buy again! The steam from brewing went up into the clock and ruined the coffee maker
"Burton W. Deane, Jr.",5.0,"March 4, 2014",Just what I expected when I placed my order.  Makes great coffee at a great price.  I've used Mr. Coffee brand for more than 25 years and was pleased with each onje of them.

Rhonda,4.0,"June 21, 2014","This maker is nice for the money i did go ahead a get the stainless craft with it as well so i can use either with this machine ,My  only complaint if you need a quick brew this isnt the maker for you brews slow but nice cup of joe,"
PIP POO,1.0,"April 16, 2015","No it didn't.  Unless you make a full pot of 10-12 cups the coffee has no aroma or taste.  We usually make 4-6 cups and it tastes like brown water.  I can't understand why, since our old, simpler ""Mr. Coffee"" makes good coffee with the same brand."
morris,2.0,"March 26, 2016",Worked great when we bought it not even 6 months in it just quit working very disappointed real reason it gets to Star is because when we bought it and first used it it brewed a cup a pot I'll coffee in like 6 minutes
Lynette,1.0,"October 3, 2015",Loved everything until it quit working after 4 months. Love the pour spout-doesn't drip or spill.
Jessica,5.0,"August 16, 2015","Just needed something basic but with a timer, love it! Especially the brew button so you can adjust how strong you want your coffee!!"
Brian,1.0,"February 22, 2016",Worked ok for a while. Then one morning left me hanging. Lights all turned on but would not brew.
Lewis J. Miller,4.0,"September 24, 2011","Top-rated by Consumer Reports, and for the most part top-rated by me (in spite of my previous negative opinion of Mr. Coffee coffeemakers).  Controls are easy to decipher, and loading the water and coffee is fairly easy.  I also like having a water filter.  The carafe is somewhat difficult to hold on to, and dribbles easily.  But ultimately it makes excellent coffee.  A good replacement for a failing Cuisinart."
Don Helms,5.0,"September 21, 2012",The coffee pot works fine.  It is fast and the coffee is hot and tastes great.  It is easy to use and looks sharp on the counter.  The only improvement would be if the digital clock was back lit as it is impossible to see from over three feet in normal lighting.

tpate,1.0,"May 30, 2015","Coffee tastes like plastic after rinsing (2x), and 10 days worth of brews. Also dumped coffee onto the counter after it should LONG been done brewing. Pretty disappointed honestly. Will probably be returning."
randycordie,5.0,"June 6, 2016",I like this coffeemaker better than the cheaper mr. coffee makers. It's just so much more easier to operate.  Timer works very well.

Joseph Smith,2.0,"May 27, 2017",worked ok for a little over a year and then totally crapped out.  used to love the mr coffee brand but the last couple units i have bought have been a complete waste of money.
Samuel A. Nash,1.0,"October 5, 2012",This coffee pot is an ill designed piece of junk. The pot dribbles and the filter holder/basket is easily installed improperly which causes the brewed coffee to overflow leading to a massive mess.Go with another brand.
RK,5.0,"August 31, 2015","So far so good.  I have had this for a month and works fine.  It is a little bit big and bulky, but looks nice and is efficient."
renee finley,5.0,"November 13, 2014",Finally a Hot Cup of coffee even after I put in milk. At a great price.  And still months later and every Morning use...still serve a nice HOT cup of coffee!!
Michael D Cook Sr,5.0,"June 1, 2016",Works as advertised. Makes a good cup of coffee. Also like the ease of using the brew later function.
Crystal,5.0,"September 18, 2015","This is actually my second one! My husband broke the carafe on our first one. Anyways, this is the best coffee maker I have had. It is very easy to set the delay and time. You can even chose the strength of your brew. The water gets added to the back/top and is very easy to add without making a mess. The filter is also on the top. The top lid just flips open and you can put your coffee in through there. Very simple and mess free. If you are the type that forgets to move the water arm over the grounds, that's ok! When you close the lid, the arm automatically moves over the coffee grounds. Stays fresh for around 2 hours. I'm very happy with it."
Abooklover,3.0,"March 12, 2014","This does the job effectively, and brews a decent cup of coffee. But it looks cheap, with kitschy-looking plastic where you'd expect stainless to be."
M. M. Hamasaki,1.0,"March 15, 2016","Purchased this #1 product in 10/2015. As of 3/14/2016, it has quit working requiring us to purchase a replacement coffee maker from our local Target. Sorry, this leading coffee maker brand name no longer on our radar for future purchases."
Alan H. Hett Sr.,4.0,"May 20, 2013","I am impressed with this coffee pot, keeps coffee hot for 2 hours.  The water filter is small but works great, our water has a chlorine odor and this small filter takes it right out.  Being left handed it is a little difficult for me to set up as the lid lifts right to left so I have to turn the machine 1/4 turn to set it up.  Would be nice to have water gauge on both sides but by turning complete unit it works OK.  It does have an end of perk signal but if you are more then 5 feet away impossible to hear, should be volume control.  Controls easy to use and it does work faster then last machines.  Best test is my wife loves the coffee it makes."
Adventurer,5.0,"March 16, 2013",This coffee maker is just as good as some of the more expensive brands.  I bought it for my mom's caregivers and they are very happy with it.  Absolutely no negatives about this product.
Paula,5.0,"July 31, 2015","After becoming totally frustrated with my Keurig, I ordered this coffee maker! I LOVE it....so much easier.....Now I have coffee ready when I wake up!! Very sleek & pretty too....."
Bill Gui,4.0,"July 6, 2016",The only coffee pot I've had that doesn't leak when filling the reservoir. I always thought the Chinese manufacturers made leaky pots on purpose to piss us off. I guess they missed this one.
Adam,1.0,"July 21, 2013","Below is a copy of the review I sent to Consumer Reports. Not sure if they'll use it but maybe they'll take note.This is not a good coffee maker. I only have it a week or so and have tried everything to get rid of that plastic taste and smell. I'm hoping it goes away rather then having to go through the process of returning it, if Amazon will take it back.The review below speaks for it self. I haven't had it long enough to have any of the other problems people are mentioning in their reviews but give it time.I will be updating this.As sent to Consumer Reports:Not a Best Buy!By Adam from Holbrook, NY on 7/21/2013Describe Yourself:Everyday DrinkerHow long have you owned it:A month or lessBottom Line:No, I would not recommend this to a friendA disappointment. I drink my coffee black so there is nothing to camouflage it. I bought this coffee maker on Consumer Reports recommendation. The plastic smell and taste in the coffee is terrible. I ran three pots of water with ¼ cup of white vinegar through it plus several plain pots of water in between and the smell and taste is barley passable.I've been a Consumer Reports subscriber for years and this is the first time I was disappointed with a product they gave a Best Buy rating. It looks nice, it's got all of the ""Bells & Whistles"" but you've got to taste the coffee, it's not worth it.Look elsewhere for a coffee maker; this is not the one you want to waste your money on.11/24/13  UPDATE:After using it for many months now & running white vinegar & water through it many times to get rid of that smell & taste it's finally coming around. I would strongly suggest running a full pot of white vinegar through it followed by 3 pots of water as one reviewer had suggested. It may solve the smell / taste problem a lot quicker. The manufacturer should have taken care of this problem before putting it out on the market.It now makes coffee like it should have originally."
Amazon Customer,4.0,"September 27, 2016",Love the functionality.  I wish they can make one that can grind at similar price point.

Bman1125,5.0,"January 18, 2015",I bought this for my son because he was going through cake cups like crazy hopefully this will save him some money and save me some money ha ha.
Diane,1.0,"August 20, 2015",This machine stopped working on July 24 and was over the 30 day return policy.  What a rip off
David-Mercer Island,2.0,"September 26, 2013","An unfortunate ""infant mortality.""  Too bad, too.  So why not just 0 or 1 stars?  Because it's a totally attractive design, which SEEMS like it should be good quality. Looking at the Cuisinart line next."
Matt,4.0,"July 12, 2016",Great inexpensive coffee maker. Looks good sitting on the counter if you have stainless appliances.
Kat,5.0,"March 9, 2015",I love this. Its easy to use and I love that its programmable. I do like that it has a water filter included. Havent made a bad cup of coffee yet
Jack5,1.0,"April 14, 2016","I had to constantly had to reset coffee with auto shut off, lasted less then 6 months, I threw it out..!"
Brandon Sullivan,3.0,"May 12, 2017",This was a good little coffee maker which worked every day for 15 months and died without warning. I guess for $30 I should be okay with that performance. Just a little disappointed.
Elia,1.0,"October 25, 2016",Stopped working after about 6 months (wouldn't turn on).  Otherwise not bad.
Another Average guy,4.0,"March 17, 2017","I agree with the people that mentioned the backlighting on the LED display is too dark to read, whether or not it's dark or light in my kitchen, so adjusting the time takes some focus.The programming is easy, filter and coffee holder are well designed, as are the replaceable filters. Setting of strong brewing works great, so I use less coffee.I would recommend filling the reservoir one cup higher than what you want as a yield.Mine stopped working a little over a year after I bought it, and a 3 minute call to customer service said that it was under warranty, and she sent me a new one, no hassle and small wait time.Yes, I would buy this again."
Rebecca Joyner,5.0,"April 1, 2014",Excellent coffee maker.  Makes perfect coffee every time. Good looking and easy to work with. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to purchase a coffee maker.

AmazonShopperTom,1.0,"May 7, 2014","This coffee maker worked fine until today.  It just stopped working, turned it off and on many times, unplugged it, waited a few hours, nothing.  All the lights are on, it just won't make any coffee."
Donald Campbell,5.0,"September 6, 2013",I have owned a lot of coffee makers but finally I have one that is perfect in every way and not as noisy as other coffee makers. Must use to really appreciate this marvel.
Shannon,4.0,"February 2, 2016",I thought this was a great coffee pot looks expensive but isn't over priced. I bought Jan.29th 2016 and today March 15th it just stopped working. I turned it on and nothing happened thank goodness I had an old trusted spare.  However Amazon gave me the information to contact Mr. Coffee it was past the amazon warranty but not the manufacturers they were incredible.  Responded to my email right away and with no hassles on my part at all responded back and are sending a replacement right away.  I am thrilled with the customer service and pray that was a fluke I really like this machine.
Sean A.,5.0,"December 14, 2013","Works great, easy to clean and maintain, and no weird flavors. I ran a bottle of white vinegar and water through it, plus a couple extra rinses before I used it. Never tasted weird or plastic to me, and it's super easy to use."
Justas,1.0,"October 3, 2016",Stopped working after 7 months...
ed,4.0,"March 29, 2013",There is no LED light in the clock portion of the coffeemaker. I guess this stops me from fixing coffee on the timer because I have to pick up the flashlight to set the timer or pull the coffeemaker more into the open to read the clock without an LED.
Dansco surprise,5.0,"June 12, 2014",Had a coffee pot that did not have a heating element to keep coffee hot. The thermal pot didn't do the trick. This one keeps my coffee just the right temp.
Carolyn Scholl,2.0,"January 19, 2016","It turns off every 2 hours.  If you are an all day coffee drinker, this is not the coffee pot for you."
Having Fun,5.0,"January 13, 2014",Coffee tastes great using the brewer.  I love this pot -- the only issue I've had is the thermal pot that should work with this maker doesn't.  Every time I've tried to brew directly to the thermal pot the coffee maker shuts off automatically!  Darn!
Ralph D. Palmer III,5.0,"March 13, 2015","Very good coffee maker! Quick, with pause and pour settings, and brews quietly. Well, except for the last few seconds before it stops brewing but that's how most coffee makers are. Purchase with extra water filters and the gold tone permanent coffee filter. It'll be worth it."
Dee,4.0,"November 12, 2014","I bought this as a gift for my brother-in-law for his house warming party.He likes it very much.  There isn't much to say.  It's a coffee pot, and it brews coffee adequately.  Good job, Mr. Coffee."
Shin Imo,4.0,"March 3, 2013","Our old Mr. Coffee was broken after two years' use, so I tried to find a different company's coffee maker. I could not find any coffee maker of same price range with good reviews, so I tried similar Mr. Coffee product. I will find out how long it lasts this time.There is one problem. Coffee is spilt when carafe is taken out. My old Mr. Coffee did not have any problem."
Doug K,5.0,"February 19, 2014","We've used it for three months. It works as designed, has well-written instructions and several good features. We particularly like the timed automatic shut-off feature."
Scenic,1.0,"March 20, 2016","It worked great for about 4 months and suddenly one day died. Reported the DOA and was sent an immediate no hassle replacement, that suffered the same fate in about 2 months! Keep looking..."
kayla conrad,5.0,"May 21, 2016",My husband loves this he likes he can set the timer to go off automatically for the next morning
ObieOneTwo,5.0,"December 29, 2014","So easy to use, nice compact design. I love the added features, such as adjusting to make the coffee strong, and the delay brew feature. A+!"
Buffalo Woman,5.0,"May 27, 2016","I've had it for about half a year, my mother uses it every day, all day, so far it's been great."
N. Abbott,1.0,"November 3, 2012","If you are thinking about buying this coffee maker, STOP!  Like many other reviewers, I did not read the negative reviews before purchasing this item.  It comes out of the box with a noxious odor that you cannot get rid of.  I put water/white vinegar and then pot after pot of plain water through it.  I then made coffee and tried it out.  I tried one cup.  The chemical taste and smell were so bad that it literally made me sick. This product should be pulled off the market.  I'm convinced it is a hazard to people's health.I think what probably happened is this: the model got a good review in Consumer Reports.  The manufacturer then had to kick up production, something changed and they started using some other material to make the product.  You know it's not made in the USA, so who knows what kind of chemicals they are using to produce the plastic in the product.  Buyer beware!I returned this one and went with"
Josh Wright,3.0,"March 2, 2015","My 2 knocks are that the display can't be read in the dark, ie it's not a lit display,and the pot tends to dribble backwards when pouring"
Chris,1.0,"August 26, 2015","This crapped out after only a year and a half, very disappointed! zero stars if possible"
Mary Hall,5.0,"January 18, 2014","I absolutely love this coffeemaker.  It brews a great cup of coffee. I like that it beeps when the brewing process is complete and turns itself off after 2 hours. It also has a setting to choose regular or strong brewing, and a time delay brewing setting."
sonja evensen,5.0,"August 1, 2014","Does the job, easy to use, only thing I would make the ""ready beep"" optional since I don't want to wake others up at my early hour of the morning."
Liza with a Z,5.0,"March 14, 2015",So far so good! Great coffee maker for the price! It's pretty quick and stays nice and hot for two hours. It's also nice and shiny :)
E. Lapham,5.0,"June 9, 2016",Bought this for my wife who is a big coffee drinker. After a month of use she says coffee is consistent and the timer is a great feature
JAB,1.0,"November 28, 2015",tasted like plastic.  threw it in trash.  nice looking machine though.  shame.
H.Amel,5.0,"February 3, 2015","Easy to use and easy on the eyes. Pours well and doesn't make a mess. I haven't noticed a difference in the brew strength feature, but all the other features are great. Easy to program and auto-shutoff is always handy."
James Harrington,5.0,"June 16, 2017",Still going strong after months of use
bobby hopkins,5.0,"October 13, 2014","Works just fine. Have had it for 1 month. So far, so good. Not too extremely expensive. I'm expecting for $40 something, this should last a couple years at least."
Esteban,4.0,"July 26, 2014","A very good coffee maker for the price. To truly upgrade you would spend twice as much. A little difficult to clean, but that's a minor issue for me."
Ponygirl,3.0,"June 12, 2016","Seems to work well for a full pot.  If I make a 6 cup pot, I don't always have success."
SoCal,5.0,"February 6, 2015",Item as Described. So glad they finally fixed the issue with spillage from the decanter from previous models.
P. Adams,5.0,"February 11, 2015","Full featured, easy to operate, makes great coffee, great value.If clock had a light it would be perfect."
MusicandtvloverRT,5.0,"January 3, 2015",This is my first coffee maker.  I've had it for just over a month now and it works great! Enjoying  pennies saved 'cause I'm not buying a cup of coffee every day.
ITomFlying,5.0,"February 24, 2015",Works great! I bought it as a coffee machine to have around when I had guests. We don't drink coffee. The price was right and I expect it will last for a very long time.
Jeannine A Barr,1.0,"September 26, 2014","I've been in a bad mood since this coffee pot arrived!!  The outcome of the coffee is a hit or miss, but consistently it's never strong enough! I ordered and received it 6 months ago - - the coffee is ALWAYS too weak - - even if i put in more grinds, sometimes the basket has dry grinds next to wet, like the water is not being disbursed evenly.It looks nice, but that doesn't really matter if the outcome is poor.  I'm looking for a new brewer, enough is enough already!I do not recommend at all :("
Tony,3.0,"August 21, 2014","It stays wet inside for a long time, this alright if i use this machine on a daily basis, but if i do not make coffee for a few days it gets gross"
Jenny,4.0,"March 31, 2014","It's a great coffeemaker for the price; nothing glamorous, but gets coffee made. I do wish it would stay heated a bit longer (heats for about 30 minutes after coffee is made)."
Eileen G.,1.0,"May 26, 2013","I had this coffee machine for barely two months before it suddenly and inexplicably stopped.At first, you had to position the coffee pot just so for the coffee to drip into the pot...and then the electricity just stopped working completely.Avoid unless you like replacing your electronics every few months."
Jordantastic,5.0,"July 26, 2016",My wife and i love this thing.  Its so SIMPLE and easy to use.  We have had NO issues.
Recent Retiree 64,5.0,"December 8, 2013",Love the ease of using - the location of the water box and the coffee ground basket.  Makes very tasty coffee - allows you to select regular or strong brew cycle.  Timer functions well.
Deborah P. King,4.0,"May 17, 2013","This was rated highly in consumer report's Money Saving Mag. , so I ordered it.  I like it just fine...price is right and so far it makes coffee as advertised.  The silver trim all over the front of the unit is plastic.  Not impressed w/that."
J. T. Brigman,5.0,"August 31, 2016",No odd smell at all.  Quick and coffee tastes good.  No drips when pouring.
FishTech,5.0,"March 4, 2016",We've used this coffee maker for about a month now and so far it's working as expected.  It costs a little more but you can pour a cup of java while it's still being brewed and it will turn itself off if you forget to turn it off yourself.  We don't use the timer feature but I see no reason it won't work as expected.We've purchased other brands in the past but we've always had better luck with Mr. Coffee coffee machines.  It seems no coffee maker other than the old school stainless steel units you put on the stove will last more than a couple years or so but Mr. Coffee seems to lead the pack in today's quality expectations.
M. Clark,5.0,"July 4, 2014",We love our new coffeemaker! The chime when it is done brewing is much quieter than older models. I also bought the stainless carafe to go with it!
Paul R. Carner,5.0,"May 13, 2017",So far so good.  Old one started leaking.
Marlayna Williamson,4.0,"March 6, 2015","I like the coffee pot...It does have that plastic (smell, taste), however, most new ones do....I hope it will work itself out....."
MissD,1.0,"September 17, 2015",Worked great for TWO months. Then just stopped and getting it replaced is more time consuming than I have available.
Happy Arizonian,4.0,"December 1, 2013","It makes good coffee, but it's not great about keeping the coffee piping hot.  It looks really nice on the counter.  It's great for the price!"
Mike Massey,1.0,"December 26, 2012",Shortest lived coffee maker I have ever bought. Died this weekend March 2015--bought it in November 2012. 2 years and 4 months.Never made more than one pot a day.
W. W. Spurgeon,4.0,"November 22, 2015","Super-solid high-tech coffeemaker -- nothing fancy, but it works great."
Kennewick Man,5.0,"June 18, 2014",Using one of these (and a model CJX21CP) every day here at work.Both models have a top that flips out of the way so you can pour water in faster without spilling.
Nancy L.,5.0,"March 9, 2015",Works great.  Just wish it were a bit shorter so it would fit under my cabinets when the top is lifted.
Buzzsaw,3.0,"May 22, 2012","It makes coffee fine. Not sure about the carafe though. Try as I might to get a spill free pour, I can not. I have tried pouring fast, slow, in between and no luck. Filling the machine with water I continue to have a puddle on the counter. Pouring a cup of coffee the same result."
Melinda Rose,5.0,"June 22, 2016",This is a very appealing Coffee pot  I just love it and it is so simple to program
carol hanks,5.0,"January 29, 2015",Mr. coffee. thanks for making a coffee pot so easy to program and a great cup of hot coffee when you wake up in the morning.  A name we can trust.
Amazon Customer,5.0,"October 27, 2014","Wonderful coffeemaker ... I researched on Consumer Reports ... was rated very highly as a ""best buy"".VERY happy with the performance, taste of the coffee (due to charcoal filter/enclosed) and ease of use and programming."
Dane Eubanks,5.0,"November 23, 2015",Brews a great cup of coffee and really enjoy the brew strength option.
E. Hurd,5.0,"December 15, 2013",I bought a fancy stainless steel coffee maker and the coffee was terrible. This inexpensive brewer makes delicious tasting coffee. I highly recommend this unit.
BEEKS,5.0,"February 16, 2014","THE COFFEE MAKER WAS VERY SLEEK LOOKING.  IT IS PROGRAMMABLE AND VERY EAST TO UNDERSTAND, COFFEE TIMER WORKS WONDERFULLY.  I WOULD ORDER AGAIN IF NEEDED."
Carl E,4.0,"January 7, 2014","I'm very pleased overall with this coffee maker. Upon reading reviews about plastic tasting coffee, I ran several pots of vinegar water and a couple of rinses with baking soda water as soon as it arrived.  The brewed coffee was delicious. It's priced reasonably, and it looks good. Its a opening for pouring in the fresh water is a little cramped, but other than that, I'm very pleased."
Bassman Dan,4.0,"January 21, 2013","A no frills coffe machine. Nice and easy to use, easy to clean and it makes great coffee. I have not experienced any trouble with this and for the price it's a great value."
Victor Ferrari Pedroso Lopes,5.0,"February 8, 2015","One of the best things I've bought on Amazon so far, 30 bucks for this, looks really nice and, most importantly, works very well."
Kindle Customer,3.0,"August 31, 2015",Coffee good but you have to keep an eye on the filter.  It collapses and causes grains to go through to the pot.
sojo,1.0,"May 17, 2014",I had to return this product twice. Both times after the first few uses the machines stopped working. It got hot and made a lot of noise but the water wouldn't flow.
G. Vasoli,5.0,"November 18, 2015","Excellent coffee maker! Well made, easy to use and the water filter makes it taste perfect every time!"
WD,5.0,"February 21, 2015","Mr Coffee seems to have won the race in this appliance catagory; best quality, lowest price and easiest control panel layouts."
Ramon L. Ruona,5.0,"November 26, 2013",This is a fine product. The only thing I can conclude about the people complaining about the plastic taste is that they simply didn't clean it before using. I agree that the clock isn't very usable but since I don't use it anyway I just don't care.
Robyn,5.0,"February 25, 2015",Great investment for a heavy coffee drinker . We always have company over and and have coffee ! We've loved having this pot!
Gardnkatz,5.0,"December 22, 2013",Chose this coffee maker because of it's ratings with Consumer Report.  So far we are very pleased with it's performance and it's looks sitting on the counter.  Was also pleased with the timely manner it was shipped and received.  Would recommend.
Susan S Peters,5.0,"April 7, 2014",I bought the chrome pot to go with the clear pot that comes with the coffee maker because we can make a pot of decaf coffee and a pot of regular coffee and they both stay warm.

T Barker,5.0,"April 14, 2014",This is a well made coffee pot.  I have purchased much more expensive pots in the past but this one has all the features I need and is easy to use.
Kevin Mr Mom,4.0,"November 8, 2015",It really is a decent cofree maker except for one thing... it is near impossible to see the clocks time unless you are right in front of it! The design and layout is nice and it makes the coffee hot enough for me so I'm happy.
Mohamed Ismael,5.0,"January 4, 2013","it is well designed, good size, well priced. worked better than the $200  coffeemaker we had. The Steel/black  color  matches well."
Christine Hauger,5.0,"January 29, 2015",LOVE this coffee maker!!  Classy looking and makes good stuff ;)  Very happy all the way around with this kitchen appliance.
JoJo,5.0,"December 31, 2013",Attractive looking. easy to use and program. Makes great coffee and keeps it at just the right temperature for two hours. I would highly recommend it.
Larry,2.0,"February 8, 2017","For some reason, the coffee is usually too weak. Coffee grinds are not thoroughly wet, as if the drip does not cover the entire area"
Kat,2.0,"March 30, 2014","I bought it because of great reviews along with the Consumer Report's recommendations. Everything works fine so far. But, I cannot get rid of the bad smell (plastic?) and coffee does not taste good either.  I use Starbucks's coffee only.  I have to buy a new coffeemaker.  I will not recommend it to my friends."
lib,3.0,"April 24, 2016",I wish the coffee would stay warm longer.
Curtis Wells,5.0,"June 7, 2014",My wife and I were looking for a coffee maker that made good coffee and kept it hot.So far it hasn`t let us down.
Amazon Customer,3.0,"August 29, 2016",Make sure you push the cup that holds the filter in firmly each time you use it or you end up with a countertop full of coffee. Not an issue unless you have guests and then they are doomed.
Rdawg,4.0,"January 6, 2013",Bout this to replace our dead coffee maker and for the casual user like myself it works awesome. Easy to clean and bunch of nice features. Cant go wrong for the price.
Brandon,2.0,"January 11, 2017",Stop working after a year. Would not purchase again.
urban trekker,5.0,"March 17, 2013","I bought it because it is one of the only low-cost models that heats the water consistently between 195 and 205.  Plus, you can pour into the reservoir and your coffee cup without dripping, like so many other carafes.  Full-flavor, hot coffee with no mess."
DE LOPEZ,5.0,"October 14, 2015","Great coffee maker! Wonderful product and price, cannot be happier. The functions are easy to use and set up in minutes."
Dom Del Prete,5.0,"September 9, 2015",I bought this product based on Consumer Reports lofty recommendation. It's excellent and a great value.
Kathie Gross,5.0,"February 17, 2014","it brews, keeps the coffee hotter then other more expensive coffee makers. I also bought the insulated carafe to extend the coffee life and I just love it. Not sure why others had issues. If you follow the recommended prep you should have excellent coffee."
Amazon Customer,5.0,"January 13, 2017",Easy to use! Even a novice coffee maker can't screw this up.
Krsco,1.0,"June 19, 2014","I was excited to get my new coffee maker.  Upon arrival I read through the directions as not to miss anything.  I decided to run a pot of only water through.  Before I hit go I wanted to set the clock, as soon as I started rolling through the minutes the numbers started freaking out and going up and down with a push of the button and sections of the 8 were missing.  I've owned this thing for about 2 hours and already hate it.  No matter what I do I cannot set the clock as the clock switches from 12 hour to 24 hour format and I can't cycle through all of the hours to get to 6:00AM.  Going up on the hours or minutes yields mixed results by skipping 1 2 or even 3 hours per push."
EZ,5.0,"March 2, 2015","6 months of regular use and still works as day 1.No need to pay $100 for a fancier one, this works just the same."
Patrick M,4.0,"October 5, 2014","My only real complaint about this coffeemaker is that the ""strong"" setting doesn't persist. It turns off after every brew."
Renae,5.0,"February 5, 2015",Love this coffeemaker.  It's so nice to pour coffee and it doesn't run down the side of the decanter.  Thanks Mr. Coffee!
Orion,1.0,"February 26, 2017","We bought this coffee pot, and after just over a year, it died.  DO NOT BUY.  This is not worth $35.  Perhaps if they discounted it down to $10."

SweetStreet,5.0,"May 5, 2015",So far so good; took a little bit to figure out the auto programming - so I read the instructions ;)  works great!
Sharon Miles,4.0,"August 8, 2016",More complicated than we need or want but it does make good coffee.
William Amiri,3.0,"April 16, 2016",This coffer maker works fine. I was concerned because I purchased it used but it doesn't seem to have any problems. I especially like how I can program it to automatically start at a certain time.
jyeager,2.0,"June 27, 2014","Water must be loaded from the rear of this coffeemaker; this is very inconvenient (and often results in you spilling water all over the place!!) . Also, coffeemaker is very slow,  plus when it signals it is done if you remove the pot immediately coffee will spill out of the machine. Exactly why this maker was rated so high is truly a mystery to me! Overall, I would not purchase this coffeemaker; we used it a few times and  then purchased a much better brand (BUNN), Spend a few more dollars and get a different machine."
cindy,1.0,"November 17, 2015",I bought this item 4 months ago and the digital clock hour and am/pm is not visible any more. Of course it is past the time to get it replaced through Amazon. This sucks!!
Beverly Fishman,5.0,"July 28, 2019",great coffee maker
jmpreskorn,4.0,"October 29, 2013","I used Consumer Reports for this choice, I had a more expensive coffee maker I had used for years and this cheaper coffee maker out performs it, there is no comparison between the two, coffee tastes 10 times better.  I'm sorry I hadn't done it sooner."
HanoiBoi,1.0,"July 23, 2015","Highly disappointed in not being able to return/replace. This broke after less than 2 months, less than 40 uses, and it's apparently too late to return.  The machine will no longer heat up, the coffee will not brew.  I would have expected much, much more than a 60 day life."
web,4.0,"January 1, 2015","Makes a great cup of coffee! However, the display is extremely hard to see and does not light up. If the display was visible it would rate 5 stars."
M. B. Ulmer,5.0,"May 11, 2013",This unit is an inexpensive but very satisfactory option. We've had 6-7 coffeemakers in the past decade. Most broke from our active lifestyle. This one makes the best coffee.
C. Heisten,5.0,"June 19, 2014",Works like  it is supposed to. Easy to use even half asleep. Doesn't cost an arm and a leg like some elite coffeemakers. Great product.
Gavin sullivan,5.0,"October 11, 2014","Had to replace the cheap carafe after one brew because it cracked during wash, but oh well.  Machine does its job for the money."
PedroC,5.0,"September 2, 2015","Mr Coffee,it is not much to say about it,its a great product for years and will recommend the seller."
Mark K,5.0,"October 1, 2016",Perfect replacement for my similar Mr. Coffee that finally wore out.
Hurstbourne,2.0,"April 10, 2014",It has too many lights and too many sounds! It beeps at you when it finishes perking  and beeps again when it turns itself off after 2 hours. And the cord was too short for the location I selected.
Beachgirl111982,5.0,"September 9, 2016",Took a little bit to figure out the settings but I love it.
dani,5.0,"May 23, 2015","Great coffee maker. The Mr Coffee emblem was upside down, I figure that's why it was so cheap, and if that bothers you it can be popped off and re-glued"
Kathleen Nulph,4.0,"August 13, 2014",1 star less - this model doesn't 'hold' the brew strength every time - my old model did - ahhh progress. But I do love my coffee...
Dan iel J. Farren Jr.,5.0,"June 18, 2014","This coffee maker is user friendly, efficient and attractive. I love waking up to the coffee already brewed and waiting to be poured!"

Manny O P,5.0,"September 24, 2015","got it for less than 20 dollars, great product, a steal for the price, ive seen at places like costco older models at more than 50 bucks, so it was definitely a good purchase, very happy"
